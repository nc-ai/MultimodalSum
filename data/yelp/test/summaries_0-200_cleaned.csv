Absolutely clean filling.  Taste delicious!   Will have you craving for more. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this restaurant sooner.  After the fact I realize this place is all the rave! ",I tried to order steak kebob but they made beef kebob. I asked for tzaziki on the side but they covered all the meat with tzaziki. Taste is more like middle eastern. Not Mediterranean. Price is good. Taste is okay.,Now this place is really good i always drive past it but today i decided to stop an check it out it is really good healthy an fresh,I was thinking this would be more of a sit down restaurant where you order from the table instead of a chipotleish style of Mediterranean food.  Thought there would be more room inside for eating.  The only thing good I had was the cucumber chiller which I would go back for.  Not so much the food/service.,Parsley Modern Mediterranean is wonderful.  Very responsive staff.  Food is wonderful.  I usually get the wraps (chicken or beef are my go-tos).  Babaganoush and the warm pita bread is pretty amazing.," Very delicious food in love with cucumber drink, couldn't decide what I wanted and one specific Gentelman whipped up something very amazing for me! By the name of Jamil great service! Thanks you and will definitely be back! ","This is Chipotle for Mediterranean food. And it. is. delicious.

I've only been here once because the location is very inconvenient for me and I'm extremely lazy about driving more than 5 minutes to go anywhere, but if it were closer, I'd be here all the time.  (It's probably better this way, I have very little self-control.)

If you like spicy - get the hot sauce.  Mix it with the white sauce, you won't be disappointed.",The food always taste fresh and leaves me very full without feeling tired.  They have had a groupon for a very long time making this place an incredible value. This is my favorite Mediterranean place.,"Fresh food, high quality food, delicious and Mediterranean.. what more can one ask for. I loved eating here and I really enjoyed the food here. It's one of those places that once you eat there you want to keep coming back, and you will. Prices are good. If you want to customize your order they'll do it for you.

Everything else mediocre at best.  Place smells too," The Falls' hidden gem -- kooky decor, decadent food at a reasonable price. No reason why you shouldn't be eating here. ",Fantastic place with phenomenal food. Very unique. Able to bring your own alcohol for a small fee.  Family atmosphere with exceptional service. One of my new favorites for sure.," Very cool decor and atmosphere, but extremely limited menu and both times we were there, they were out of something we ordered. Also, a little pricey for what you get. "," This is my second time visiting---and the food has always been tasty.  They don't skip on the seafood.  We didn't come with a reservation, which kind of threw them off their game. Food didn't come out very quickly this time, however, there was a large party so for the small kitchen it was understandable.  My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake. The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit/debit cards...cash or check only. ",Very good! Many items made from scratch and fish is cleaned there. The portions aren't too big. Everything was flavored well. Would def return.,"The food is great here. It can be a little expensive, but that doesn't take away from the good quality food.

6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg,"It could be a lot better, but with no competition around, they dont have to be. 

The chicken is basic charbroiled, some times overcooked & dry, averagely seasoned, and portions are ok. 

Sirloin is adequate, plays it safe with the amount of marinade & spice. But at least its decently quality & tender meat. 

Beans are average beans & they fill their role as a side item just fine. 
The salsa is terrible mashed tomatoes. 

Service is lacking, slow, and cash only is annoying. ","Nice simple Mexican food at a great price, love the charbroiled steak and the beans so flavorful with out a lot of stuff added. Called my order in but when I walked inside the smell was so good I had to tell them to make mine to eat in. Next time I will try the combo cause the beef was so tasty I know that charbroiled chicken will be just a good if not better. Just remember CASH ONLY you can eat for as little as $5 but bring $10 and you can get anything you want."," We call this ""Red Chicken."" It's consistently good, always fresh and tasty and you can't beat the prices. I love both the chicken and the beef. The beans are rather bland, but the salsa, rice,  and pickled onions all go together for an explosion of flavor. ","My bro and I have found this place by chance. The smell from the restaurant street were delicious and we couldn't wait to taste it! The best beef and chicken you'll find in Phoenix! And it's only 15 minutes away from the airport! For sure, I will recommend it!"," To my homesick Indianz from Arizona, if you want home cooked food (beef, beans, tortillas) this is THE PLACE.  Tri-tip grilled on actual mesquite, tortillas that taste as close to homemade as possible, and they will actually grill jalapenos for you.  And the beans, oh the beans, just like Moms.  Eat here, you will be happy. ",This is as close as the chicken that you will get in Mexico this stuff is to die for you can't even simulated  at home with the El Pollo Loco seasoning salt. we go to Rocky Point Mexico and gotta stop and get the chicken in town right on the Main Street it's killer.," I like this place. The food here is like what you'd get at a typical taco stand in Nogales, but without the dysentery.

The chicken and beef are equally tasty, but I tend to favor the beef because it's boneless and less work trying to get it all into the tortillas. "," One of the best deals and delicious beef and chicken combinations out there. It is a whole in the wall and just a gem. I will totally cater with a tray of this stuff, but may end up hoarding it to myself.",Mexican food that reminds me of what my mom used to make. It is fresh and high quality but simple and not overly complicated. The chicken is by far their specialty here and if you stop by I recommend trying it.

I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place. "," Not good at all. The young staff basically ignores you if you have any grey hair. The food was just OK, but I won't be back. The Good Egg is much better. ",Great hip breakfast in Gilbert. Food and waitress Kayla were excellent. Reviews didn't do it justice. We will be back.,"Visited for the first time this morning and even though it was recommended by a friend who'd dined 2-3 times before I was hesitant seeing all the negative reviews. We thought it was great! Arrived at 8:15, sat on the patio and had great food & service. We had the brioche french toast, waffle dogs & scrambled eggs - all were great! We will definitely be back.","I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent.  But we came here for food not to meet the staff.  Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The ""real maple syrup"" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.   Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza).",We love the service and food. The staff is always friendly. Daniela always takes care of us and remembers us by name!!! It's our favorite breakfast place.,"Had the biscuits and gravy...they were OK. (Bland, not as warm as they could have been).  Also couldn't help but notice the couple sitting next to us, sending both of their meals back for being cold.  
I realize this location has just opened - so I may wait a while before giving Over Easy another go.
3 stars are for our friendly waitress and the yummy Bloody Mary mix."," I really never post any reviews but this place deserves it. I come here often and the food tastes great like always. The brioche banana toast are to die for as well as the pancakes, I've really never tasted anything like it before. The place is cozy and clean and the staff is amazing, not really much more to ask for except I wish they add crepes that would the cherry on top.","This is an ok breakfast joint.  The food is kind of bland for the hefty price you have to pay.  I had the Dolly breakfast sandwich and I feel like it lacked flavor.  The staff could be more attentive.

Typical business district downtown type eatery.  This is nothing fancy but it does hit the spot and is very well maintained.  If I were in the area, I would eat here again for a quick bite to eat for decent food and excellent service.   Food=3, Place=3, and Service=5.","This review is for the salad bar, I feel like I need to warn you.  It's a total rip-off because they weigh your food.  $13 and some change for a salad!  Need I say more.  I definitely would've left out the rubber tasting chicken and nasty croutons.  I will stick with Jason's Deli, better selection and you can have all the salad you want for one price."," I was looking for just a place to get breakfast and coffee that didn't involve flashing lights or clouds of smoke.  I was relived to find this cafe within walking distance of my downtown hotel!  I had a toasted marshmallow iced latte and a breakfast burrito.  I don't remember which one I ordered but it was a vegetarian burrito with avocado and egg as two main ingredients.  And isn't that what is really most important?  it was also fun to people watch all the law enforcement officers and legal professionals as they came in.  Plus, free wi-fi!  Will definitely come again. ",We found this place walking toward another breakfast cafe and decided to try their food instead. It was a great choice!

Antrese has been our server every time so far and we've been impressed by how nice and helpful she has been! Definitely recommend.," This place is my new favorite!  Their coffee is soo good, you can make a ton of different combinations or just stick to the basics.  Their selection of teas are great too and they are amazing quality!  Super yummy. I had a pesto chicken pannini that was effing delicious.  The staff is super nice, the girls are really sweet.  Everything about this place it's awesome.   Totally go there! "," Let`s start with the good stuff first. Clean place and friendly workers. The paninis are great (a bit overpriced) but you definitely get what you pay for as it is a big portion. The buffet is great especially if you`re down on cash and want a variety of food on your plate. 

Cons: Breakfast is not great at all! I would definitely not recommend it at all. I`d rather go to Mcdonald`s for the same quality of food at a much, much lesser price. "," Awesome place for nice coffee and great delicious food!!! 
I would definitely recommend it ! 
Our new favorite restaurant for lunch in Downtown Las Vegas  
Thanks to the beautiful owner, Silvia! "," Great lunch spot downtown. Food tastes good. They also have one of the best-tasting coffees around - they use Illy, of course. Prices reasonable.","This place has a nice buffet, which in itself is a compliment and a negative. Their actual food they bring you isn't as good as the buffet in general, and they charge you by weight at the salad bar which is something you wouldn't really expect. It can come out expensive.

Here's a summary of Rosemary's:
fine dining that's not on the strip
excellent service
high but not extravagant prices
delicious food

One star off for the decor inside - a drop ceiling when people are spending $100/head??? 

*note: $75/person no show fee on weekend reservations!"," Rosemary's is a great little restaurant. I have been there many times and it's always good. It is more of a fine dining place without the expense. I had a fantastic butternut squash soup with pepitas. My husband loved the sweetbreads (the brain kind, not the bread kind). The menu has something for everyone, whether they're picky or adventurous. I have never a had a bad meal here. And by eating there you support local business which is always a good thing. "," They're a bit off the strip, but not a far cab ride away.

Haven't been back to Vegas recently, but still remember that this place is amazing. The service is blow-your-mind adorable. The wait staff is incredible and they're such sweethearts. Eventhough I found their lamb very ""lamb-ie"" (which ""if it tastes that way, then the chef wanted it that way,"" ), I was still so impressed with everything else that it didn't even matter. 

Rosemary's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants ever. "," I have been going to Rosemary's for years. I have even been there for winemaker dinners. Rosemary's is the kind of place you should go to once a year or so. I really can't describe this place. Honestly, every high end restaurant I go into, I compare to this place. The location will throw you off. It is WAY off the strip. Which is great because you don't get the crazy bachelor/bachlorette party's.

This is very much a local place. It is reputation is on word of mouth. I always say it is the place you take your secretary to if you don't want your wife to know. lol ","Sad News.... 

Looking forward to my second visit here since May of 2010....

I called today for reservations and was told they closed for good.

Very sad... awesome place!"," Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip. ","I'm a fan.

I've been there perhaps 10 times?  Never had a bad dinner.

Always with great service, consistent food quality.

One criticism would be that their menu is pretty...ehh...unchanging.

I think it's almost the same stuff all the time.  It does get a little old and although having your staples menu is good, it needs change.","go for lunch...good deal for $23!
the shrimp dish was aite.
the mahimahi is a must!
and the pecan pie was heaven!

service was top notch...

don't think could come for dinner...quite expensive!
nicely decorated!
really loved the bathrooms, very cute!","If you're in Vegas and want to head off the strip for some great food Rosemary's is a great place to check out. Some of the decor is a little dated but don't let that deter you. The food that they make is amazing, and has a lot of the home made flavor that you are looking for.

The place has some very weird art on display bot other than that the staff is very friendly. 

I will be coming here often. ","Very good wraps from this cool spot in Tremont.  Easy to get in and out of.  I only picked up and carried out.

As far as the food goes, it is simple and fresh ingrediants that are priced well.  I reccomend."," This place is sweet! I tried their special sandwich of the day - veggie grilled cheese. It had cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and lots more delicious veggies. The sandwiches are huge so you'll definitely have some left overs! Can't wait to try more sandwiches and soups from this place. ","Best lunch option in tremont. Its that simple.  Sandwiches are creative and they do NOT skimp you on the meat. I have to say that i often have trouble finishing my entire sandwich. Turkey #27 is a mainstay and highly recommended + roasted red pepper and on the asiago cheese bread. Sandwiches come with Lays (baked or full-fat). The only drawback is that the sandwiches tend to come HEAVY on the mayo, do yourself a favor and always ask for it on the side.","I LOVE this place!  I do not eat meat and they have very creative options for meatless sandwiches.  There is one girl that works there that is way friendlier than the others.....if everyone acted like her, this would have been an easy 5 stars.

I think it was the chicken salad pesto sandwich amaaaazing!  La bodega is this nice little shop right at the corner of a quiet neighborhood The staff is really nice and quick. The food is all fresh and sandwiches come with some chips, there's a small selection of flavors to choose from. I would definitely return when in Cleveland! ","Amazing, amazing sandwiches/subs.  I believe that the last time I went I got the #45 and it was out of this world.  It blows away any chain restaurants such as Subway or Quizno's.

Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning. A+ "," So I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original!  I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.

The hostess was a bit dry, bored, and wrung out but the rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly so I won't let her influence my opinion. This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great! I got their grilled cheese and french fries which were fantastic, they use a really thick bread which made the sandwich even better. I would definitely come here again...if I'm ever delayed and forced to fly Southwest again -_____-","This place is delicious.  Its a great place to go when you get off your flight, or if you are waiting for your plane to come.  It has delectable breakfast food.

A few years ago I also had the store gun smith change the sights on a few pistols and they did an excellent job. Whenever I purchase firearms out of state, I strongly recommend any Las Vegans to get it shipped to this location. "," This store is HUGE and is a great place to buy thinks for use in the outdoors. I love the entry with the life-size animals, the aquarium, and the water feature. Love this place. Come here if you need anything for the outdoors!! ",This was a fun place to visit even if you did not buy anything.  There were so many outdoor and sport gear.  An large aquarium and a large selection of hunted animal.  My friend from another country also felt fancinate to see a large selection of guns and ammo.  Guns were outlawed in some other country.," This place is a riot.  From a ""tourist"" stand point there is suprisingly alot of fun to be had.  Especially if you don't take yourself seriously.  My Dad, friend and I had an under cover security guard watching us closely by the time we left (not very sneaky sir).  Be sure to watch the fishing demonstration, watching live fish strike bait live is pretty dang cool.  If you're in Vegas, like the outdoors, and feel like releasing some of your redneck side, this place is great. ","Disappointed in the service we received today. The place was extremely packed with Holiday shoppers and only 4 checkout lanes were open. Stood in long lines to purchase our items and the cashier did not apologize for the wait, instead made the comment that she wasn't sorry because she has a job. Bass Pro should consider having a bigger staff this close to Christmas and have every checkout lane open."," I don't really actually shop at Bass Pro. But I love walking around, looking at everything, and playing the games at Bass Pro. It's a fun store to just meander about. And they have different shooting games, checkers, etc. that you can play. Plus there's the stream and waterfall with fish, turtles, and ducks, as well as all the stuffed critters all over the store. It's a free/cheap way to spend a couple of hours. And if you do happen to be into fishing and/or hunting, you'll find what you need here. All in all, I'm a fan simply because I always have fun walking around and looking at everything here. ","Purchased a pair of upland pants for hunting season on sale. Only paid $29. First time I wore them, I got them very dirty and the reinforced fronts ripped out. Returned for a full in store refund. Was only $29, but still, great service even though the product (Browning) was mediocre."," Went with my wife to go and check out the gun counter for their up and coming Black Friday sale and seen some firearms we wanted to buy that day that wasn't listed for the sale. The Employees all had rude trash attitudes especially one named Erwin. I spoke with the manager Brad and suggested that the employees in that department take a diversity education training.
Due to their ignorance I won't be shopping there again.",Fun place to visit the place was very large. It had a large aquarium and the fishing demonstration was top notch.

The staff is nice and they always greet you at the door. The line where you build your bowl is always tidy and looks pretty. The staff is always monitoring it to make sure everything looks good. The grill is always hot and they clean it often. So no old caked on burnt food from 2 hours ago. They offer doggie bags for .50. Trust me it tastes even better the next day too. Definitely a place that will fill you up.," My MIL's boyfriend took us here to meet up with some of his local family when they were in town. I didn't know what to expect walking in at all, and actually almost didn't come (we had some deliveries scheduled that day, but they finished early), and I'm so glad I made it! Others have described the process, and they're right. It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though. I will say the beef was better than the chicken (in my opinion at least) so I'll be sticking with that next time. "," This isnt the worst food I have ever tried but I definitly will NOT be going back there anytime soon.

I dont know how fresh the vegetables are but it is a good alternative to fast food. 
The meat is frozen and kinda grossed me out so I recommend the tofu, although I cant speak for its quality.

The service was fast and you get to decide how much of each ingredient you want. "," Went into the resturant last night with my husband and daughter and baby. Didn't know how the whole system worked... The lady that checked us in explained everything and was super friendly.
The food tasted nice and fresh and the portion was huge. The kids were super excited to find out the meal came with ice cream at the end.
Right before we left the lady working at the front came and asked how everything was. The costumer service was on point and we will definitely be going back. ",I emailed the company just to let them know about my experience and the employees that were acting so unprofessional.  I was contacted (hadn't expected that) and was very impressed at the customer service and concern over my experience.

I will give them another chance. 5 stars for this managers response and handling of the situation.," My boyfriend and I come here after we fight! It's actual therapy... we leave happy.  The food is incredible, the mood is nice and quiet, and you don't wait for ever... "," Every time I go to YC''s I always have a great experience. Service is great, food is good, place is always clean! The price is the best because it's not expensive but the food is awesome. Making your own sauces is a fun experience also. ",If you know how to pack your bowl its ok. The card reader automatically adds 15% tip so you gotta either figure it out or tip 15%...haha. $30 seemed a bit much for 2 ppl. They charge .50 per take home container,"This is a good place to come if you are looking to build your own custom bowl of food and know exactly what you want. It can be a little bit daunting when you are looking at all the options, but the staff is attentive and available to help you pick out your entrees.

For some reason my online orders couldn't be processed so she call target.com for me and handle everything with them for me! Spoke to Terrence about it and he was great too!," Oh hey, it's a Target.

","Simply put; Great customer service, close by, clean-- and that's including the restrooms, at least for the most part...

They don't have much of a grocery area, mostly dry goods but I love the $1 bins and their clearances, awesome!","This has to be one of my favorite Targets by far! Very clean and organized. I love shopping here because I don't feel rushed to grab and go like I do in Walmart, just to get away from the riff raff. I can never go in and just buy what I came in for! lol!

The shopping experience I get here is never negative in the slightest way. Great products, great prices, great store. Highly recommended. Only thing I don't like is being able to swipe my Target card and not needing to sign for purchases under $50. Better make certain I never lose my card!",I had the best experience with Jane! I came in today for a few things and am always in a rush. They pharmacy paged her and she opened up the locked toothbrushes in record time. Additionally she recommended some facial masks. She then checked me out and I was swiftly on my way. Jane had the sweetest disposition and was knowledgeable in her company's products. I was so delighted with her I opened up a Target card and want to continue shopping here! Awesome experience and totally brightened my day. :),If I could give them negative stars I would! Their price match policy is an absolute joke. Target will only honor the price match policy on THEIR OWN website if it lists a dollar amount not if lists buy one get one half off. Ridiculous. So now I get to go home repurchase everything online only to return it when it arrives so I can receive the second item at 50% off.  Losing another customer Target!,"Target is definitely my go to store for just about everything.  They're clean (this one is), affordable, good quality, no long lines, easy return/exchange, convenient parking and location, and great customer service!  

I've also been going to the pharmacy and I love their $4.00 prescription program.  Whether or not you have insurance they will still give it you for $4.00 as long as its in that list.  Their pharmacist and pharmacy tech are really nice, not like other pharmacies.","I've been to a lot of Targets in my life, and I must say, this is one of the better ones.

5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"The restaurant seems small compared to others in the hotel, but they packed several large parties into a separate room here for some reason.  Loved the dark wood decor, and the food was great, although the value for the price may be a negative factor.

My lamb saddle was delicious, and the martinis were excellent.  Service was very poor, mainly due to a server that would disappear for long stretches of time, so it took us a while to get our order even started.  

This was a nice, nice dinner, but I think for the price there are other better options in this hotel, and certainly in Vegas overall. "," Just had a small early brunch here.  Almost deserted for some reason.  But the food was very good.  Good service too.  Decor is traditional, but felt maybe a little out dated. "," Small portions for the price.

I guess it is ok if you dig the high end dining frech food scene, but it wasn't my thing. "," Really cute French Cafe in the Venetian Hotel.  Loved the decor, the cafe bistro tables and chairs.  I've had both breakfast and lunch here, both were excellent.  

Salad Nicoise had some nice pieces of seared tuna, I liked the slice of bagette toast with tapenade and an anchovie fillet.  Mussels Mariniere was also very good, lots of garlic!  The fries were not as good as Bouchon's but few are.  Don't think you can go wrong eating here. "," Saturday morning breakfast.

Hung over and in need of some food. I had the croquette monsieur, while the really hung over guy next to me had the pino omlette. He enjoyed as much as his stomach could handle.

Really friendly staff, and the food was good.

Odd decor around you for breakfast, but hey its french, and its vegas, so there's bound to be something not right. "," Originally, we plan on going to Bouchon. The manager told us that they were doing a yearly maintenance and had closed early. He then offered to walked us to Pinot Brasserie and told the hostess to take very good care of us because it was my boyfriend and i anniversary. 

Really good price for french food. We both enjoyed it very much. Pinot Royale chilled tray filled with shell fish was to die for. On top of that, the creme brÃ»lÃ©e that we ordered for dessert was on the house with ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate in chocolate. That totally made our night, not to mention everything was soooo DELICIOUS! "," By the end of the week here, I resorted to mostly soup and salad.

Here I tried the french onion soup which was salty, but a bit too cheesy as well.

To top it off, I had the Nicoise salad, tuna was okay, bit too peppery.  

I was full after lunch, but it could have been the soup that really filled me up.

Our afternoon server was definitely very much in the joking mood and provided great entertainment for the table. "," Before this dinner we popped into La Cave and maybe my taste buds were on the high from the fresh food but when we got here for dinner I was disappointed. 
The decor was very typical and nothing to write home about. Our waitress didn't seem that on ""her game"" that evening - forgetting specials and how things are prepared that are on the menu everyday. Food was just ok - i have had a steak much better prepared than this one.","This is a decent restaurant.  They serve both breakfast and lunch.  I had the Nicoise salad.  It was ok.

If you're looking for great boba milk tea, Tea Street is the place to go.","Went here 2 days ago and it was my first visit. I live around the corner and had been skeptic to try a new boba place since I already had my favorite on Dobson. I can say for a first visit this place is AMAZING. Great service, my cousin loved it, they had so many drinks. I had gotten the green tea milk tea and was worried about the dairy bc I'm lactose intolerant but the cashier/tea barista assured me that all of the milk teas are dairy free, FANTASTIC. It was really good, great drinks and not to mention the cashier lady was super cute plus plus. 

I will be coming back.",Lots of different flavors of milk tea and every one I've tried has tasted amazing. Prices are reasonably fair compared to other tea and Boba places. Very friendly staff. I'd recommend trying the Brown Sugar Milk Tea if you like sweet drinks!," Visited again today, ordered matcha milk tea and earl grey milk tea. The barista made sure the drink wasn't too sweet, but both milk teas did not have the flavor of tea I was looking for in the last three milk teas I've tried (TeaStreet, Strawberry, Osmanthus). I won't hold that against them and hope to try more milk teas and top ten drinks. "," I'm sitting here, as we speak, digesting my large peach milk tea that had the popping lychee boba in it. 

Typically I'm waiting for that ""ugh I ate too much"" feeling that I get after boba or real sweet teas... 

Doesn't seem to be coming. 

The milk tea was super light and the peach tasted really good. Lychee added a bit of tartness which is fantastic. 

Huge menu! Can't wait to come back and try more. ","""Like! Green"", that's the drink I got...

You know how scotch whiskey and sushi can be an acquired taste? This drink is like that. 

Initially, this drink gives a overwhelmingly almond fragrance. I hated it, it was gross. However I spent 5 bucks on this damn drink, so I continued and begrudgingly sucked it up. Weirdly, as I was halfway done, I  stopped noticing the weird almond flavor and started tasting the green tea matcha. I'm confused, and probably will have something traditional at this place next time, if I have to come back.","The drinks here aren't so great, and that would normally make me give fewer stars, but their ""Grand Canyon"" on their Top 10 list is THA ABSOLUTE BOMB!! It's that great it makes up for anything and everything else. Don't bother coming here to drink anything else. The place could be dirty for all I care (it isn't), as long as you have a Grand Canyon you're having 5 's!!!"," The drinks here are great since they're freshly brewed and you can taste the tea, but the girl working had to hustle to get all drinks made and take the orders at the same time. It just takes so long since there are a lot of people waiting. I felt bad ordering six drinks while she already had other drinks ordered that she didn't make yet with a group of people in line behind me.

The Brisket was moist and broke apart so easily, very succulent.  I drenched in their signature tomato based bbq sauce which was my favorite part of the meal.   The pulled pork was good as well but the brisket was so much better.  I felt the bun on the sandwich could have  been toasted more as it was kind of dry.

The ribs were the highpoint of the meal and were among the worst I've ever had. Yinz better stay far away. "," I'm a big BBQ fan, but unfortunately YinzBurgh is only middle-of-the road. On the one hand, their meals are cheap and filling, which is great, but the BBQ isn't the best I've had. Mostly, the meat seems a bit dry.

If you are in Pittsburgh looking for BBQ, I would recommend you either try a different cuisine or come over to my place! "," Do my eyes deceive me? Is there legit barbecue in Pittsburgh?! 

Going to Yinzburgh is so much easier than driving down to Georgia when you're craving good bbq. Try the pulled pork, try the ribs, try the bbq burritos! I love gorging on this restaurant's food. 

Yinzburgh is truly an oddity in Oakland. Pierogies are fine, so is pizza, but where in this state can you find proper barbecue? Yinzburgh, that's where. "," The flavors and hospitality were absolutely amazing. The only reason they did not get five stars, was  the temperature of the food. The meat came out at just above room temp and the sauce was cold. "," In line with the other reviews, the owners here are fantastic.  The woman behind the counter walked me through their process and got me to sample all the sauces.  The second time back she wanted me to try out a new dish they had just put on the menu.

I can only speak to their chicken, but it is fantastic.  The meat just falls off the bone and the sauces really compliment the dry rub.  I tried the extra spicy and the honey mustard -- both are great.

Coffee, feta spinach quiche /w deliciously seasoned potato wedges, hame and brie sandwich on italian bread. Oh, and one more thing, ricotta blueberry pancakes... The quiche crust has a sweetness, so if you're into savory / sweet combos. The quality of eggs and spinach used is up there. The ricotta pancakes were so good, I think its in the batter, who knows ? I've got a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh :=) "," This place was a nice find on the strip. We ducked in not expecting much, but ended up having a delicious breakfast for a reasonable price. I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!

It took so long to get our drinks that we had them for only a few minutes before we got the call our table was ready and had to leave. We were looking at a 45 minute wait! It probably took almost half an hour for 4 drinks to arrive, 3 of which were the same.

The drink I had (Friday night special) was absolutely delicious but the slow service hindered the enjoyment of the beverage.",Orgasmically delicious pulled pork eggs benny & great friendly sevice. What more can a gal ask for at brunch?," Great new restaurant. Love the fresh baked muffins, cheesy omelette, home fries, and Mac 'n cheese. The food is similar to School in liberty village and doesn't disappoint. Patio is really nice and shaded. Only been here twice at off hours but was still Surprised this place wasn't busier. Given the quality of food and service, I'd expect it to be packed any time of day!

Worth a try, sure."," place was nice and cute, came here on a tuesday morning and there was almost no one with was nice. the waiter was very nice. ordered the blueberry hill pancakes. very filling, wasn't able to finish because there was so much but it was too sweet for me and i just did not like it. eating something that sweet in the morning did not make me feel great. i'm sure the other things on their menu are better but sadly i will not be coming back for more. "," Had the daily special of Chicken,waffle,and poached egg. My husband had the pancakes with the bananas. The brunch meal was meh, not amazing like at other places.

"," Ok, I'm not from the South, I'm not a BBQ connoisseur BUT I've eaten enough good BBQ to know what a beef brisket sandwich is supposed to taste like.  What I had at Famous Dave's earlier this afternoon was NOT BBQ.  It was thawed meat that tasted like Little League hot dogs and with absolutely no BBQ sauce.  Honestly, the best part of my meal was the bread.  Yeah, that's what I came for...the bread.  Do yourself a favor and skip Famous Dave's.

If this is a franchised operation than the quality control is really lacking.  Our first visit to Capriotti's and with so many other quality places I doubt if they will get us as repeat customers.  Well, here it is.  We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it.  Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold.  No taste at all in either.  For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits.  Will not return "," This place is always good, I think the owner actually made my sandwich last time I was there , owner or manager, anyway it was superb! quite flavorful, even the next day it tasted just as good. Grab a Capistrami you can't go wrong, until next time Cappie's , be well. "," one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...

In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go. ","#1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly.","Worst service I have seen at a capriotti's.

If you order take out/delivery the seafood broth comes in a separate bowl and you can add as much of it to the noodle as you like.  The sweet and sour chicken was just alright, nothing special to note. The pad thai has a generous amount of chicken and shrimp and tastes great.

I've ordered the Thai fried fish cake, I find it lacking in flavour. 

I was craving for curry fish balls, the curry was not bad but the curry was a bit thick. 

The fried tofu was very tasty. Just enough flavour and it was crunchy. I really enjoyed this.

I've also ordered the Tom yum noodles, it was okay as the soup lacked the spice. 

I will definitely come back for the tofu and the iced tea! ","Since the only other pho restaurant is pho 88 by empress, the food here is decent. However, service is lacking. I suppose you don't go to these places for service, but because of the other options around, I will not go back just for the average food."," OK place for a bowl of pho in the Finch area.

Not a fan - they were not careful at all and my cuticles were mangled after this. I live down town so cheap nail places aren't hard to find and the one near me takes their time for the same price. These girls were not the kindest to my friend or I even when we tried making polite conversation and left great tips. Language barriers aside - a smile is pretty universal...so is being all rammy-jammy with sharp nail tools...

Na thanks. Not sure what the raves are about but I will be sticking to my own place now. ","This really is an awesome nail salon.  It is spotlessly clean (including the bathroom!), very chic-ly decorated, and has some of the loveliest ladies around.  I came here for a after-hours mani/pedi party with a group of friends, and we had a blast.  Nailsense had Pretty Woman on their large flat screen while we ate, drank, and were buffed and polished to perfection.  And the cost?  A mani/pedi here is $35.  Yep, you read that right.  35 BUCKS!  A complete steal for the level of service.

DEFINITELY will be back!","3.5/5
ok i think i had much higher expectations of this place b/c of the reviews
my sister & i came 4 pedicures and she got shellac mani as well. they sat us side by side which was nice, the place was packed - which it seems like it always is
there are tons and tons of colours to pick out, which is nice
regular pedicure but my sister said they went to town with her cuticles for her manicure that it actually hurt
the place is really nice and clean and i want to give it another chance when im in the area for shellac mani myself"," I have been to Nailsense several times, for waxing and manicure. A great salon with great prices.

*Waxing: Both Kim and Thuy are excellent and provide useful advice throughout the process... I won't say they make it painless but they make it as pleasant as waxing can be! And the place is very clean. I won't go anywhere else for my waxing!

Kim is also amazing for manicures, I had the gel nails done a few months ago and everyone at work kept asking me where I had them done! "," They do not do fake nails, of any kind. So if you need a fill don't bother. The website is deceiving, it allows you to pick the option of a gel set. I picked that option, and then good thing that I called before I went to ask the price or I would have gone all the way there for nothing! take that option off your website! apparently its been over a year since you offered gel nails! Disappointed... "," Always have a great experience here.  I was an hour late to my last waxing appt due to unforeseen circumstances--they still fit me in and were very nice about it.  
The staff are very nice and I'm always impressed with the results. ","This place is excellent to get your waxing or manicure done.
Starting coming here to get my waxing done by Thuy, she is very professional and gentle.
Then recently started getting mani-pedis. I got shellac nails done by Kim, she did an excellent job, my nails didnt chip for nearly 3 weeks! 
Overall, I highly recommend this place. 
Its clean, workers are professional and the prices are acceptable! Much cheaper then some over-hyped downtown places with less professional people","The staff are sometimes in a rush and therefore are not always careful - cutting cuticles too short and not providing a very relaxing experience.

She was not very helpful and our food came 45 min later cold! The general manager was very nice very helpful," Came here for an event that was supposed to be four hours long, we all left after one. The best part of this bar was the DJ that we hired. The staff was extremely condescending and rude.

She threatened to kick me out. Don't waste your time or money ","Good layout, friendly staff, and excellent waffle fries. The place didn't get jumping until almost midnight. The ratio of men to women was terrible, about 75/25 percent so if you're a single guy, be aware. Maybe I came on a bad night.",Terrible service - messed our order up three times.  Philly sliders were cold.  Nachos have squeeze cheese and cold chicken.  Can't understand why they can't deliver on such a tiny menu if simple bar food.

We took advantage of their special offer which was $100 per person guaranteed you a seat and all the premium drinks you wanted!  The manager was so wonderful as was our very  accommodating and friendly waitress/bartender Liz.  We hardly drank!  But we could if we had wanted to!  The other people that came to watch the games were very nice too, even if they were for the other teams. The food was really good, too.  All in all, a great experience!","This is one of those places that tries so hard to be an edgy ""dive"" bar but fails on all levels. The hostess was horrible at her job and the wait staff weren't much better. The food is terrible and the free drink was more like a half drink.

I ended up having the corned beef sandwich since I didn't get one for St. Patty's day last month. It was very good except for the slightly soggy bottom piece of bread. I could still hold it though...just a little messy. ",I've spent a good deal of time in Robbie's bar and restaurant and have always been impressed by their food and the friendliness of their staff.  We love the patio for lunch and every now and then swing by for the after dinner hours when things get exciting.  Robbie himself spends a good deal of time there and has no end of amusing stories.  Just one of my favorite places in Tempe," A fun place to hang out, the food is good and the people are fun! ",Best Corned beef sandwich on rye w/ chips and a slight add of Colman's Mustard....  Fantastic!," Visited during a Thursday Happy Hour.  The place was virtually deserted, and after ordering the ""Tavern Steak"" I think I know why.  Hopefully, all of their entrees aren't this bad.  If I owned a restaurant I would be ashamed and  embarrassed to put out  this lousy of a product.  The service was woeful as well. "," I normally go to Rula Bula on Mill ave. A friend of mine told me about Robbie Fox's, and knowing how much i enjoy a good pub I had to give it a try. Not only was the food exceptional (a great burger), but the atmosphere was welcoming, the server at my table was very attractive, conscientious, and attentive to my needs (not to mention the sexy european accent). Price wise the food and drink is worth every penny. Definitely my newest haunt. ",It is a great place with great crowd and good service. If you are on mill this is the only place you should go. Avoid all the other bars," Well the down town Tempe location is great of course. The staff was great and I guess they just changed ownership. The menu was small the food was just so so. I had the shepherds pie , it was ok not bad. Wife had the corn beer and cabbage, the corn beer was like a steak not that tender.  We also had the corn dog sasusage which didnt look appetizing. It did taste better than it looked. Was kinda dark as I also seen the fish and chips that looked dark on the breading.  The people were great beer was cold.  They need to work on the food and menu.

I'll definitely go back.,"The food was a hit this time unlike last time I was here. Although the salad could improve a bit. The croutons in the Caesar salad were huge and since you can't really cut croutons I didn't eat them. The Pad Thai with shrimps was excellent. The calamari, although greesy, was very tasty. If you become a vVVIP member you get a $10 discount. The service was much better this time, maybe because we were seated inside and not in the patio.","Ok - for the food at Jack Astors is good but it is not 4 stars by my rating scale!  What gets this location to 4 stars overall is the roof top patio!

Today I took two of my men tees for lunch and we grabbed a beer under the sun! Being 4 or 5 stories above Yonge street was great and this patio is huge!

Great patio and view on a summer day with mist and shade on the rooftop. I like their new drink menu but since they changed their food menu, I haven't been a fan. So it's usual if opt out of food and just settle for drinks.","Overpriced everything, low quality food. Save your money and go down the road to Nome, It's more luxurious and cost less. You would have to be foolish to pay $20+ for a burger, when Hero burgers is a quarter the price and down the road. Really not worth it, No offence."," Jack Astor's (this location) is hands down my favourite rooftop patio in North York. Food is alright, service is alright, price range is similar to restaurants like milestones and sharks. If quality dining experience (food wise) is what you're looking for I wouldn't recommend but definitely for drinks and hanging out with a decent view. 
Location is pretty convenient - near the TTC station and they have street parking available.
P.s. Recommend their Chicken quesadillas, Veggie pizza, the fishbowl cocktails. (Avoid their shrimp pasta - watery, Calamari - a bit greasy)  
Overall, good experience! ",Really liked coming here! It was my first time and the food was amazing! The service was good and the atmosphere was great. It's definitely on the loud side and very casual. I had the chicken poutine and it was to die for. My boyfriend has the sirloin burger with pulled pork on it (big Texas burger I think?) and it was amazing. I had to have a second giant bite of it. Come here with friends for drinks for sure.,"The atmosphere inside is a bit loud, but the  large rooftop patio is a nice option. The service is decent, but you'll probably get quicker service if you're seated inside. Things are a bit pricey here but they do offer a VIP membership that can save you some money.

065c76tt1dXBNmoGBymUgQ,I enjoyed my Chili Cheese dog. The meat in the chili was just spicy enough for my taste. The staff was great and pleasant even on a busy day. The food is a little pricey for a hot dog but worth it!,This is one of the best things I've ever ate.  It's located in Container Park- Downtown Las Vegas.  It's not your traditional hotdog.  The Chef deserves a handshake for sure!!!!  Awesome..," Awwwww, no chilli dogs til Fri, Sat, Sunday!  I really wanted that chilli dog!  Also the beer I like it's seasonal, so I will have to return in the fall for the brew I like.  But it was a good experience.  I tried the crunchy dog.  It was different.....Since they didn't have the chilli dog, I was forced to try something else.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but you know when your mouth is watering for what you want, and it's not available......... yea!   Service was good, and quick. No issues with that.  I will be back on a Fri, Sat or Sunday for a chilli dog! "," High quality gourmet hot dogs. Kind of pricey and a long wait time for hot dogs, but definitely something different. El Mexicano and the Grand Father dog are excellent choices ","Hipster little joint here. The menu is pretty straight forward and they have some unique selections for hot dogs. We had hot dogs, the cheeseburger, and chicken fingers (for the kids). I personally had El Mexicano and it was super tasty, but $7 for a single hot dog is a little bit ridiculous. The kids didn't like the chicken fingers and the burger was just bad. Customer service was not great either. The cashier had a little of an attitude problem taking our ""complex"" order."," Too many good options! I love hot dogs and this place had some of the best toppings I've ever seen... Rivaling my own home creations.

Quail egg? Yum. Seaweed? How did I not think of that before?

We grabbed a beer as well and sat in the outdoor deck space. This whole container park is pretty adorable and wholesome... Especially when you stop to realize you're in Vegas.

Overall, this spot is approachable and also hip... Much like a hot dog with a quail egg on it. ",I ordered the El Mexicano and the Cheffini's dogs and both were great. The Mexicano had a green cilantro sauce on top that was perfectly tangy with a lot of flavor. And the crunch of the bacon wrapped around the hot dog was a great texture change. The Cheffini's dog had a sweet and savory combo that worked great together and that little bits of chips was a delicious surprise.,"Went here at 10 pm. They close at 11. I wanted to other fries and dude working said no. Unless I were to ""too him a few dollars"" to turn the fryer back on. Horrible customer service dude was a chode. Won't be visiting again.","If you're in the mood for a hot dog and are looking for something a bit nicer than a normal dog this is the place to go.

The filet was thinner than expected, but cooked as ordered and delicious. The cervichi appetizer was also fabulous. The service was very good, there was a slight wait to be acknowledged, but once we were, food orders were quick and staff very friendly.  The only downside was the size of my cocktail, though made with fresh ingredients and well executed, for a $9-10 drink, it was small!

Yes they're a seafood restaurant but offer other options and have a gluten free menu. They're owned under Outback Steakhouse so the food is guaranteed delicious","This restaurant is a good casual restaurant, it may not be the best restaurant in town but it's far from the worst. The food always comes out well prepared, and is made with fresh high quality ingredients, but the staff can be a bit inattentive.

We asked for 1 inch of hair all around and when we got him back he had been cut so that very little hair remained. We maintain our dogs hair by brushing him every single day because we like long hair. Not only they did cut him too short but they cut a huge chunk out of his neck! The haircut is not even.

The saunas I don't really care for, but that's because I felt like a roasting potato.

Unfortunately, they raised the day pass price to $55 but it's worth it to go at least once."," This spa is amazing. I go to Vegas often and I look forward to this spa almost as much as the trip. The atmosphere is relaxing. When I leave there I feel like I was rejuvenated from head to toe.
The steam room and roman baths are amazing. I can find myself there for hours and hour just relaxing on the heated lounge chairs by the Roman baths. 
There are snack, tea, water and juices available. There is every thing you can think of to get ready after your experience. No need to bring hair brushes or curling/straighteners they have them!
Absolutely, love this place. Wish I lived closer I'd be a frequent visitor! "," Pricey, but worth it.   Fridays and Saturdays can get busy, which may disturb some as there is quite a bit of talking.   The ice room is my favorite retreat in here, make sure you check it out. "," The spa is beautiful!  The service was a bit spotty.  My masseuse was amazing.  I had just been in a rear end collision and she was able to work all of my knots out.  Feeling much better now.  I would definitely recommend their dry sauna, you know how some sauna's are just too hot, well this one I must say was just perfect.  Avoid the chill room.  It's not snowflakes coming out of the ceiling, it's soap.  It's just kinda uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  Oh - I don't mind being cold, like I love the cold plunge, the chill room just didn't float my boat. "," I got a day pass for this spa and it was a wonderful experience, especially right before I had to take a long red eye flight home! I was so relaxed. Loved the heated beds as well as the hot/cold baths. The Arctic room was great as well, and the shower facilities and amenities were all one could ask for! The showers had Vichy sprayers which was a pleasant surprise and bonus! The day pass is a great deal and the best on the strip! If you want to relax, this is the place to go! ",We stayed at Wynn but decided to visit the SPA in Caesars Palace based on positive reviews. It didn't fail us. Massages come with access to the bath. A must go in Vegas!,"The next time you're looking to unwind and want to visit a spa this is a great option. The place is a bit pricey, but completely worth every dollar. The decor of the place is luxurious and beautiful. The staff is also very accommodating and they work hard to make sure that everyone feels comfortable all the time.

I'm picky about my seafood since I used to live in the Bay Area and know what fresh good sushi should taste like. 

Everything was tasty and the Tuna was nice and firm just the way I like it. I will be ordering from this place again for sure. It's #3 on my list with Spicy Tuna being #2 and Osaka being at the top.

We came here for our friends birthday and the owner came out spoke with us.  Very nice and inviting.  She even gave my friend a present and gave us a chef's special dish. 

We will come back here again, if just for the excellent service. ","We had dinner at Sai for the first time tonight. We had the AYCE sushi. Every roll was delicious! (There was very very minimal wait time in between ordering rolls.) The service was fantastic! Our waiter, Juan, was attentive, friendly, and made fantastic suggestions when we were ordering.

It's got a dive atmosphere, but in a classy way - a way that won't leave you wanting to put on a pair of latex gloves before touching anything. The walls are covered in velvet. And well, it's just an awesome decor and atmosphere. Granted, yes, it is really smokey, but that just adds to the dive ambiance IMHO. They don't serve food. The beer is good.

We ordered chicken BBQ hot wings and the order took forever, but when it finally arrived it was sooo good, probably one of the best wings i've ever had. So worth the wait, but... the service sucked. The waitress was so blah she couldn't care any less. The same people at the host stand, they were just uninviting. 
Food was really good but i wouldn't go back, too snobby for Vegas, way too many places around there to eat at. Wouldn't go back. ","Horrible service, mediocre food.

Service: very friendly and you can see they are passionate in customer and in their work. 

Food: we only sample the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It is on point. 

Drinks: they use Pilot Coffee Roasters Blend. I quite enjoy the Cortado. Since they are still soft opening, they are adjusting the taste. Hope they can work on the crema. It is still a better espresso drink in Markham. 

I am sure will come back to try their brunch items and home baked goods. ","The worst experience ever in Toronto. Waited for more than 15 mins with no one coming help us. Went to ask for seats, the waiter was so rude saying"" I already told ur friend (which he didn't) why u still asking? It's selfserve. Go serve urself!""
Literally WTF. It's a small restaurant which I understand and not expecting much customer service from them. But this is way too much.

What can I say, the place fills up quickly. Open face omelette pork belly my wife says its like Filipino style and was impressed. Had a hot mocha with the breakfast. The side salad matched well.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Pita bread, but that's my ONLY complaint ","The place is clean and the servers are nice. 

The food was a little lacking in flavor. We had Chicken kaabob, kefta, fries and rice. The chicken was good, needed more marination. The kefta was boring and the rice was horrible, old and dry. The garlic spread they use with the chicken is awesome and very very strong garlic. 

I used the yelp deal but the meal only can to $22 so I have a yelp deal to go back. I just am not sure I will.

on most nights so pretend it's a NYC place. We made reservations as I strongly recommend for anyone dining.  My favorite was the farfalle pasta with pistachios, shrimp and saffron. The app of Brussels sprouts and parsnip purÃ©e pizza was incredible my delicious. I have found a new favorite dinner destination. ",Great food! Very cute restaurant. It is a little loud when the main room is full but the pizza was delicious.,Food was good but portions are really small for the price. Wine is overpriced.   Bring your wallet.,Grilled octopus is soft and tasty. However it has a rather strong fishy smell. The spaghetti with shrimp dish is excellent. The pasta is fresh and cooked perfectly al dente. The brick oven pizza with prosciutto and brussel sprouts are delicious!," Awful. The noise level is deafening. Right after the four of us paid paid several hundred dollars for dinner, we were asked to vacate our table because someone else was waiting for it. Wait, what?! None of us will ever go there again nor will we recommend it. Too bad because one of the group is on the board of a large public company HQ in Charlotte. Stagioni won't get a second chance to make a good first impression. ",LOVE this place! Tried a little of everything from appetizers to desert and it was flawless. Lovely atmosphere; highly recommend for a group dinner or date night.," First of all this could be literally the only restaraunt in NC that serves zucchini flowers... For this reason alone I showed up and Stagoni did NOT disaapoint. LIGHT, DELICATE, FLAVORFUL!! Anyone can make squash blossoms them but these were fabulous! The mussles? So good we ordered them twice. I am a very picky Italian and everything we had we enjoyed! ","We had two apps, $13.00 for 3 pork meatballs and $15.00 for a fig tart that was to sweet that it should have been a dessert rather than an app. Place is way expensive for Italian food. The wine menu again is very expensive for the selection, same glass of pinto at wolfgangs is $3.00 less cheaper. Glad we tried it but you pay for the Myers Park area instead of quantity and quality of the food.","This is a good place to stop by if you are looking for a family dinner environment. The main dining room can be a bit loud with kids, but that's something that is encouraged by the restaurant to try to make it have a family friendly environment. The food always comes out perfect though, they always make everything fresh and it shows. The pricing is also a little high for the size, but the quality is there.",562PgsOzKdneLoUqcgMXIQ,2Bdbj3pi0uH9cYA1F35KTg,J0OqAJw39iC_5_1_Os6CUw,LKKLZ5cckLXz8BTYWfhVLw,T0a3YgQY5cJziGN-o2SzpA,S4c5D-doPQjws5qYi5pYtw,x8pUBoNhBuNvzWU8QcwT0w,us_hw-q2ZcYdYc96AtWgxA

It looked light as pork. - June 6, 2016

You could say their beef's got beef with my small intestine. Been in the restroom all day. Good god! Health inspection, please. Beef is spoiled! Don't order the beef or you'll be in pain like me.",good food except for steamed seabass. youll know if it frozen and not worth the price. yang chow was superb amd the generals chicken. beef broccoli was also tasty and flavorful. will definetely comeback but will avoid the steamed fish coz its not fresh,yes the food is incredibly authentic chinese but it has been discovered and now extremely busy. come early to avoid the madness and crowds.,Dont know how good the food is but if Ive been standing by the door more than 15' and no one greets?!! Not even a hello and ask how many people??,Horrible service. I waited for 10 minutes in an empty restaurant waiting for the hostess to set me. They couldn't pause the their conversation for a minute to just nod and point me to a seat.,"As soon as I walked in, all 3 waitresses turned their backs and headed to talk among themselves in the back. After having stood by the door for a good minute, one of the waitress motioned me to a table. Didn't hand me a menu or asked what I wanted to drink. Right then, a Chinese (?) couple came in. They were greeted warmly and escorted to their tables. I'm Filipino by the way. 3 more minutes of waiting and nobody came to take my order. I just left..."," If you need a place to get the freshest and most authentic Chinese food in town, Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe is the place to go. Whether you are craving peking duck, lobster, or even freshwater eel, this restaurant will definitely fulfill your cravings.

There was this AMAZING waitress here that was able to provide me with extraordinary service and a welcoming atmosphere. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants here in Vegas and nothing compares to Hong Kong Garden. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place with fresh and authentic Chinese food!","I don't know where to start. It's authentic, yeah, but their ingredients might not be the best quality. Service is lackluster. Seems the waitresses are too busy talking to themselves, and are too busy gossiping to pay attention to what's going on around them.  It's pure chaos when it's busy, so check it out when it's not.

The house is amazing 
It actually a converted house! So freakin cool "," Visiting from Berkeley and love the ambiance here, nice old school vibe and super friendly waitress. Ordered a veggie omelette with bacon on the side, with a salad. 

Super fresh and came out fast. Had a great conversation with my friend Neil and loved the experience here. A must visit brunch place in toronto, one of my new favorites! ","The food isnt worth the horrible service. 

Rude aggressive staff. Told us to wait outside in a -10 weather in a rude tone:""you have to wait outside, okay? "" while he shoved me with his hands. Keep your hands to yourself. 

We left at a heatbeat and we're never going back."," Love love love. The potato salad is awesome. So far I've tried the breakfast pocket and the breakfast tacos and both left me feeling very satisfied. The sidewalk patio is great in the summer. Prices are reasonable, service has always been good and I've never had to wait for a table (both times I've gone at breakfast on a weekday). My waiter today was a riot. "," For the price, this place ain't a bad brunch option. The scrambled eggs weren't half bad. The OJ was nice. I'de say you're going here more for folksy atmosphere than the food.

Their omelette topping choices are not exactly varied. Their featured omelette for the day I went had cauliflower in it. cauliflower?

if you want a killer brunch, hoof cafe is my pick. nobody in the city does pig like those guys. "," i really like this place. Its always really busy though and not big enough to accommodate the high demand, which means they could raise their prices, but they don't, which is nice. Good food, friendly staff, well priced. More places in toronto should be like this. ",Delicious grilled cheese - I had the Brie and Pear one and it was a rich mix of sweet and savoury (salty) that paired nicely with potato salad that had a more light taste.,"Nice ambiance and atmosphere. Relaxing place and service is top notch. The food is also very good. The place can get a little busy though so a lot of rushing around for the staff, but they keep their cool.

You will not find smile on the Owners Face.
No cooler hot like hell.
Not Clean to expected standards.
Inexpensive food. 
restaurant is crammed. ",Oh my goodness yummy chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. SO HAPPY to see a good Indian place on this side of town. I think businesses come and go in the shopping center these guys are in though so eat there! So I can continue to eat there. :)," food here is average with poor quality
for example paneer butter masala was lime water with no paneer and few onions
and place is not very hygenic
the owner took order from folks and took payments written something on paper for phone order cleaned tables and he went to kitchen put masala stuff on the dosa with bare hands and rolled dosa with bare left and right hand. come on atleast use plastic gloves it so gross
not going again ","should be rated as 0.  worst place to eat in phoenix. worst indian food. raw and uncooked. stinking meat. rotten meat served. will cause food poisoning.  never eat in this place. if you eat, eat at your own risk."," The food isn't always fresh, but when it is, it is okay. The portions aren't that great. But the worst thing is the customer service. I was getting food to go and asked for a napkin, the woman said ""we are out of napkins"". I just looked at her in disbelief. She sighed, turned around and went into the back. Returned with a new pack of napkins, opened them in front of my eyes and handed me a couple. Nice. ",Found a replacement place for Biryani very near to this restaurant opened Pastries N Chaat which serves alot better food than Bawarchi atleast he wont lie saying Biryani is fresh and serve stale food....,"The food is mostly pretty good. Not a place to dine in. Small stuffy and hot, with the hot oil & burners in close vicinity to the seats. The biryani & chicken curry are good. Paneer mattar (ie., cheese with peas) is a waste, you get 3 pieces of paneer floating in curry or 4 if you're lucky. Being in Scottsdale, decent Indian food is hard to come by. So this little hole in the wall stands out! It is on the spicy side, which is great if you like that. The big plus is... they recently opened an Indian grocery store next door. They have a good variety of spices, daals etc.","This place really isn't that great.  The atmosphere could be so much better.  The restaurant is pretty small and hot, so its really annoying when there are a lot of people.  It just makes me feel uncomfortable.  The food is average at its very best.  At its worst, you get chicken that is old, with sauce that is watered down and flavorless.

We felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do - he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew.  Needless to say, lackluster service, mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will NEVER return."," We like the food and prices are reasonable. Our biggest complaint is the service. It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of ""Not my table."" ""Not my problem."" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us. "," Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all. ","Went to dinner with 4 others and had another bad experience at the Macaroni Grill.  When will we ever learn?  The server was not only inattentive, but p o'd when we asked to be moved to another table.  When the food came it was at best, luke warm.  They had run out of one of our ordered dishes, but didn't inform us until 20 minutes after we had ordered.  Running out at 6:00 p.m.: Really? More delay and no apologies. There is no excuse for a cold meal and poor service.  We will not go back since the Grill seems not to care and there are plenty of other restaurants which do."," The service is kind and friendly. 

However there was complementary bread served.

The Pizza I ordered was undercooked and had very little sauce.

Macaroni Grill has unfortunately taken a dive.  Best to avoid the place or at the very least this location. ","I know this is a chain, but Between this and Olive Garden, I would def pick this place. Service was great at this location and food not bad at all, although not excellent, I think it still deserves a good 4 stars","I had a  2 for 1 $9.00 express dinner coupon so we order up 2 dinners to go. The deal was 9 min or its free, it took 20, but since I was getting 2 meals for $9.00 I did not make a fuss. 

 The actual pasta was fine and amount was fair but it  had maybe a 1/4 of a chicken breast. The chicken tasted like it came from Taco Bell, VERY processed. The sauce straight from a can.

 I have had much better frozen dinners. My husband and I used to like Macaroni Grill it sad too see its food go so down hill.","The atmosphere was great, friendly server. Although the food I think is served from frozen. I ordered mama trio. The two of three items were great. Plate came out hot, couldn't touch it. Went to eat lasagna and was ice cold in the center, nit even warm. 
The server apologized about it offered new one or reheat this one. I chose a new one to go. I saw her go tell manager. The manager didn't even come over and say anything. I was not even acknowledged on my way out and walked past 3 people. I will not be going back. Over priced for frozen food.","I'm really not a fan of Macaroni Grill, well, at least THIS Macaroni Grill.  The staff is slow and really doesn't seem to car about providing quality service.  It took well over 30 minutes to get my food and the place wasn't even packed with people.  I ordered pizza and it didn't taste right.  I think it wasn't fully cooked.

I got a veggie burrito (definitely a thumbs up) and an assortment of drinks, all delicious.  You can tell the bartender cares about what he puts together, and it was fun chatting with him before we ate.  The atmosphere is almost trying too hard, but that really only adds to it's charm, as you notice more and more interesting details as you look around (parachute frogs on the vent, etc).  I'm hoping to stop in again very soon to try their veggie nachos or tacos. ",Great happy hour beer special with friendly bartenders.  This is a good place to start and end the night.  There food is decent (gringo Mex) as well and I like the Mexican out door atmosphere feel.,Bangin' tacos served all night long. Perfect for when you stumble in at 1:45 am all famished and looking for something tasty just before you head home.,"Best reverse happy hour in Tempe. 4 stars is only for the bar -- not the food as my liver was in charge that night. Chronic Tacos is one of those places where things can go downhill quickly - but all in fun and cheap drinks. The $3 rockstar/vodkas were our poisons of choice. Busy, but not crowded Chronic at 9-ish was fun and likeable wih their comfortable black leather booths.

Our happy hour last week that turned into a reverse happy hour resulting in free acrobatic entertainment by yours truly on the light rail. At Chronic Tacos, just remember: buyer beware."," Four reasons I come here: it's downstairs from where I work, they have decent prices, the bartender makes a pretty good margarita and I like the patio.

Not a huge fan of their food and in the summertime when the windows are closed it kinda stinks when you first walk in, but overall it's a good place for drinks on a patio-type day on Mill.",Great place to go for entertainment and to hang out with friends.

It seems the problem is before the wash because not many cars in line after the wash but way backed up before the wash.," Pathetic car wash. If you want good service, value for your money go to another car wash. They left patches of dirt on the tires, body and on the bumper. Even after complaining to the so called ""Manager"", nothing happened. I paid for the VIP car wash. Left disappointed. Will never go back. Stay away from this car wash. ","It is always hard to review Danny's. They wash your car for $12 bucks but you always want them to do more. 

They vacuum, wash, dust, do windows, tires and dry your car every time. Usually in less then 45min. TOTALLY worth the money. 

Sure they miss the air freshener or a window or a floor mat you paid extra to have cleaned.... still better then I do on my own. I would spend hours cleaning for almost the same results.

We sat at the bar, with maybe 10 customers in the whole restaurant and a good amount of servers. About 10 min to be asked if I wanted a drink. When the bill came. We promptly paid it and waited forever for the bartender to finish arraigning bottles and putzing around before finally taking out payment."," Honesty, nothing special about the burgers. I was expecting a burger experience.  All I got was an average patty with decent topping. Actually the patty wasn't great. Didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

The food is good though and the service staff appeared to be solid.","This place has the best burgers, period. Not only that but they have so many different choices as far as what kind of burger you want, its insane. The also have some amazing non burger choices too if your in the mood.

Will definitely  come back!","This is a huge restaurant; it has 2 separate patios and a ton of indoor seating. I've come here on many separate occasions in the past, and while it hasn't disappointed me, I can't say I've ever been wow-ed. I had the small pork souvlaki dinner with rice and roasted potatoes ($14.95). The portion sizes are good and the tzatziki is super garlicky (I do love garlic). The potatoes they gave me (3) were also huge!! So, I left very full (and feeling like I undid my workout just before)."," Love the great comfort food this place offers, they also have a fab patio in the summer! "," This place definitely has problems with consistency, but it has remained one of my favourite places on the danforth. I usually only go there for take-out, electing to go to pantheon when I want to get a table. At one point the grill men were actually greeks (maybe a greek guy still pulls an occasional shift) but that seems like it was ages ago.

In any case, the lamb sandwich on a bun with extra tzatziki is my pick, although sometimes the chunks of lamb are just too fatty and make for a chewing struggle. Depends on the day. Oh yeah, and be prepared for onion breath. Those are raw onions :) ",I was in here today November the 7th  we ordered few things I'm surprised how terrible it is the quality it's not there like they used to be the best on the Danforth when some Greek American had purchased the place since he sold it n the knew  guys picked it up its not the same terrible The management should wake up and smell the coffee and  not to get greedy  the most recent operator looks like a lost farmer ....!!!!," This is the best Greek restaurant on the Danforth- Greek Town!

You can't really go wrong with any of the Greek restaurants in this area - we have tried just about all of them over the years, but if you want the best one, Astoria is it.
Patio if great. Service always fantastic.  One litre bottles of wine: great. It probably has the largest seating capacity in the area so getting is usually not a problem. Opa! "," This was my favourite restaurant on the Danforth but unfortunately, it no longer is. The prices have increased and the quality of food has decreased. 

Today I ordered their pork souvlaki dinner. The starter salad was too salty to eat and on top of that, the pork was burnt to a crisp. 

Other restaurants on the Danforth will charge the same (some even less) and give you far better quality food. I would only go to Astoria as a last resort from here on in. ",Decent food at a decent price is my tag line for this place.  The portions are generous and the service was friendly.  It seems like this place has been around for a while and you know what you are getting in this family style-ish restaurant.  This won't be the best Greek meal you'll ever have though.  I think it hits the spot but this place seems to be more about the quantity and deriving flavor with lots of cheese & oil as opposed to using the best or fanciest ingredients on the market.  The wine and beer list is also quite limiting.  So just enjoy it for what it is.,"There's some issues here with being consistent all the time, but it's a big place and the service is generally good. The prices have gone up since it first opened and the food quality isn't consistent at all. It's either good, OK, or just bad. You'd expect to pay a lot lower in price for the quality of food they are serving. It's got a good comfort feeling and ambiance to it though.",ggsrfgJkitVIniKAl5yYCw,nT_mF7hSKIDJvTUNhgDVZg,yFSQxL5D3S9T5ApBrRfjJQ,222uztEJKDcruHEECznUqA,g6oCsH4HLOm_vN97XNCgEw,eaU2Ats-um4jmGFuNZCPQQ,ITkuxRk977qRM42Z4KP1YA,5SP8QPLNyevRtAar0OLozg

"," Great evening (Oct.) under the stars!  First of all, it's not a French restaurant, rather the chef is French.  They describe themselves as a ""casual American bistro.""  Several of us went and had a great meal!  We shared appetizers: crab cakes, calamari, salmon sushi (special that day), and sweet potato fries.  They all were great (although the fries could have been crispier for me).  We all enjoyed our entrees.  I had the risotto with shrimp and asparagus and found it delicious.  We shared a couple of decadent desserts (made fresh and change daily).  We enjoyed the brownie with apricot pieces and a gelato with chocolate crunchies. "," Great ambiance. Food was very fresh tasting, and all the sandwiches I've had so far are delicious. You won't regret trying this place. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu here. ",They open 7am to 9pm today came and had breakfast at 745... Such a beautiful Labor Day I decided to come have breakfast before heading to red rock... And I wasn't disappointed... Such a lovely cafe in Summerlin... Coffee was great staff very pleasant and welcoming bonini and ham egg quiche was amazing will definitely be coming back,"Really good food IF you stay and get past the way they do NOT greet you!  It's not France--you need to have good customer service!!!  ONLY because my husband is Belgian, we stayed, he's used to bad service.  It's NOT clear when you walk in what to do--sit?  Menus?  Ordering at front and having 3-4 empty/half assed stares by too many people is a Mc Donald's concept,  and uncomfortable.  Especially the blond running the register.  Put her somewhere else, NOT front!  Drip coffee overpriced then $.75 refill?  Mon Dieu!  Again, very good, get your customer service/set up straightened out.  Bonne Chance!!!"," Hidden lunch spot.  This is the perfect lunch setting including indoor outdoor seating. Customers order at the counter, and items are brought to the table. The food is healthy including vegan and gluten free options, but it actually tastes delicious.  The prices are fair and portions generous.  We will definitely be back. ",Very disappointed. Staff needs a better education on what they're serving so they can recommend properly. I'm all for healthy but it has to taste good too. Sweet potato fries were very good but served cold. I cannot recommend this as a lunch spot.,Very cute inside and has potential but unfortunately the salad I ordered was not very fresh and had sliced apples on it and the sticker was still on the fruit!! Ahh that's a big no no for me .... Prolly won't be returning:(,"The chef here is French and works to make a tasty fusion of French and casual American food. The staff can be a little bit inattentive, but that isn't too much of a problem since the food is very good. The decor around the restaurant is very nice and inviting though. I highly recommend checking them out the next time that you are in the mood for some lunch.",avnWx2PINEzYhDVhq2oR7w,AWwLVvHqtgFBgBiqpQuPLw,xOdSgW1yTTqDglfF7k6Nmw,TOaZ67MRnQN_aXvDIulpYw,_OBPQTW62hxRblznc9zHrA,xhp7g4XI0UjZ1IZy4QoBtw,EHGBedgZ1uK0rqr1WG2Igg,n_oHvQgDzRff5pLO3PFIKw

Laid back atmosphere, James Taylor-like live music, and the pulled pork sandwich tasted akin to Blue Ridge Pig BBQ from back East AKA best bbq on the planet earth.  The service was friendly and fast.  Definitely going back. ","My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!! The spicy cilantro wings BANG!!! Lol...looved them. We sat on the patio and it was cool to people watch all the local neighborhood folk. The DJ played lots of house music which gets me going!! Cant wait to go back in 2 weeks for the next Boom56 set :)","You might really like the squishy, comfortably wide, white barstools at Kitchen 56. I do. The bar straddles the patio and the restaurant, which is good for people watching, too. Although, you might be distracted by some kitchen traffic.

I never find myself saying ""let's go for dinner,"" but definitely, ""let's meet there."" Other restaurants - the Grind is nearby - have menus to brag about. But Kitchen 56 has an open feel, with appreciable curiosities on the walls, and the service has been uniformly engaging.",The food is very sub par at this place and the owners and staff are incredibly rude. I've tried this place out a couple times but when I ended up getting flies in my pizza that was a no go for me. The bartenders drink on the job and it just seems way to pricey for the type of food and service that you get out of this place.,"Kitchen 56 is a great place to stop in during lunch or happy hour. We've had virtually every thing on the menu and the food is always great. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area and will periodically host live music. The restaurant also has a wonderful history. Their downsides are that they redid the menu last year and a lot of our favorites are no longer there, service has been lacking a little lately and they raised their prices (they would've had more stars if it weren't for these things). I guess restaurants think this is something they should automatically do when they are in the Arcadia area.","Probably the 90th time I've been here, but I can't say enough good things about it. This time I just stopped in for a beer, and had a wonderful conversation with Jess, the bartender. She recommended a great beer, and I was once again reminded why I love this place. Just a great place with great food and drinks, and super friendly people."," Food Ok. Subpar service. Found out later that the 'waiter' was the General Manager. Waited over half. An hr for the food, and even later for the check. I. hope this guy doesn't try to cook. He would just drop stuff and leave, like a fly landing on the table, then taking off before you could swat it. He never offered us drinks, and WE had to ask for a desert menus. This place got a lot of hype on check please Arizona, which wasn't earned based on our experience. "," Very limited menu, but the service and food are both good. I just wish there were more options. I was cornered into a salad, which was great, but the bowls are weird and make it hard not to get your lettuce all over your table.","Not the best food in the world, but not the worst either. The atmosphere here is really nice and it's fun. The outdoor seating area is nice too and comfortable. Menu could be bigger, it's a bit limited but again, it's the people and atmosphere here that makes it a nice place to visit.",1Xr8iT2SMwsArEto9gCX7A,pxDSSpmOW_HI3U8KtjH9Ow,DjlObNkmXApGsOQYKxgWQA,hmzSZMzyyqNiWzWzQarVEQ,2660nQeE1R0UFXItkNbulQ,zjv1PSIaSkn9lIzmCZXk7g,tErj36iHTW1WwoZBfLa8-A,F2TfcwCCwBqp17_FTZ5G9w

If you want to have an award winning burger experience, try the chipotle avocado burger! Seriously, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.

The top of it, the owner is one of the friendliest business owner I've ever met, taking care of customers in a way that is way over any reasonable expectation. Highly recommended place for even the pickiest guests. "," Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out because of the high reviews. The food was pretty good, and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful ",What an AMAZING place!! Top notch deli with fantastic employees!!! I had the Chicken Chipotle Panini and it was unbelievable! Located inside the office building behind the Marriot Hotel what a hidden gem I suggest you check this one out.,Excellent place for breakfast or lunch. I have never been disappointed but always pleasantly surprised. Were I come from a lot of small places like this are family owned and you're always treated like family.  It's nice to find a place with the same atmosphere. Thanks. See you soon.," This is a hidden gem in south Scottsdale. The place is run by a great family. The food was great, especially the sides! I'd like to come back and try the salads next time. "," Couldn't believe how good the burger from here was. I got the bacon and cheddar burger and it tasted like it came from an upscale ""fine"" burger restaurant. The prices are great and it's easy to get in and get out around lunch time.

Oh yeah, Roberto is quite a friendly guy! ",Good healthy and fresh sandwiches. The place is not cheap for a sandwich but be sure of what you want but the food is good.," Best breakfast sandwich is the Laurel Market with goat cheese, eggs, bacon and your choice of homemade bread from Nova. Yum! "," Love love love their sandwiches. They're quick and convenient, and they offer many vegetarian friendly options. The only bad thing is that it can be difficult to choose which sandwich to go with. I haven't tried the breakfast sandwiches yet but hope to do so soon. Note that there are no tables. This is a place to grab a quick meal, snack or drink to go. ",Lots of very interesting sandwich and wrap options. Probably the most interesting and unique sandwiches and wraps ive ever had in one place to be honest. Definitely take time to read the menu. I have never even thought of a lot of the toppings they chose to put on their sandwiches. And they are all good. I've tried most," LOVE everything about this place - the employees, the sandwiches, the tid bit selection, the snacks and drinks! What I don't love is their use of styrofoam coffee cups. They are busy enough to spend a bit more on greener cups. C'mon guys invest into your community and environment. "," Great market for neat wine, snacks, and lunch! 

Beautiful salads with perfect avocados and fresh ingrediants. 

I recommend the chicken torta: black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, tomato, on a bolillo roll. Yum, yum, yum! ","I don't know of a better place in Charlotte to get a sandwich or a wrap.  This one for me is an A+.  I've recently introduced (hooked) about 10 people at work onto Laurel Market.  It's at least a 45 minute round trip for us to go for lunch (takeout) but it's worth the time/gas!  So far, my favorite and the crowd favorite is the #4.  Most of us get it on a Spinach or Tomato Basil wrap.  It's incredible!  Turkey/Pepperjack/LTO/Bacon/Chipotle spread... unbeatable.","If you are looking for a fresh and friendly place to get a sandwich you should check out this shop.

4Wou6LarHqefHP21qRu0Ag,I've been here before when I've been treated bad or with a bad attitude. But today there was a cashier and she was alone in the whole store but she really made it work! And she was so nice to the kid I had with me. She really made this place so much better then I've ever seen it be. She should be a role model for everyone else who is working at this place!,Great food and smoothies but horrible service. This place is always way understaffed. Young kids working here and always arguing in front of customers and the wait time is really long.,"I want to give this place a good review, but its so tough when they are continually understaffed. I've never been here once when it took less than 3 minutes to get my order put in. It usually takes another 5-10 minutes to get a smoothie and half a sandwich too. If they could get this down to 3-4 minutes for a full order they would be 5-stars for sure."," I really like Tropical Smoothies establishments. However, this store is inefficient and dirty. No sense ordering ahead as your order isn't prepared till you arrive. Owners need to hire at least two people and teach them how to keep the place clean. ","Oh, I should have looked at the ratings before I ordered from this location. Shocker that it's so low. Not! Ordered a chicken salad sandwich toasted, baked lays chips and a smoothie. Got a salad and a smoothie. This was ordered on UberEATS as I'm working from home today, so paid 4.99 for delivery. Horrible! They don't answer their phone, so I can't even let them know."," Great smoothies, crappy service.  Miss Rosemarie, the heavyset brunette, should NOT be on the register.  Girlfriend is a little too gruff w/ customers & has attitude.  A little smile & a thank you would've been great.  Not a good representation of the store. ","I have been here before.  Never so dissatisfied.  My smoothie tastes like blended ice absolutely zero flavor. I was unable to order 3 different choices as they didn't have the ingredients.  I finally settled on my 4th choice and the chicken was all fat. Staff was friendly and apologetic , So not their fault","Stopped by after volleyball practice on a 95 degree evening to find one employee working. While it wasn't super busy, the poor lady was working her tail off to finish making orders so she could ring in new orders.. Poor thing was alone to run the show and she said she would be for the next hour n half. She was kind and friendly and still managed to do it all. Yeah, service was slow but I couldn't complain because she was working hard. She deserves a 5 star but this review will reflect that no smoothie place should have one employee like that and let alone not on a 95 degree May evening.","The smoothies here are great, the other food is hit or miss. They always seem to  be understaffed, which causes stress and tension between the staff themselves as well as between the staff and customers. There are times when it's busy but there's only one staff member.

The atmosphere is cozy and friendly.  We can not wait to return and try other dishes.","The donuts. The beignets. That's the reason why you should brunch at E2. My favorite is the chocolate pistachio. The doughnut was light and fluffy with the right amount of sauce to cover it. Be sure to bring cash since brunch is cash-only.

I couldn't have asked for a better experience.,Found a sushi place close by to the hotel I stay at.  Drinks were great and sashimi was amazing.  So fresh.  Just wish I knew what each fish was!," Keep driving. Perhaps hibachi is good. Ordered three items from the non-hibachi menu. Ebi shumai (shrimp) were small and bland. Hamachi jalapeÃ±o had no zip or spice, and worst of all, calamari tempura was barely warm and tough. Sent it back, came back quickly and it was hot and tough. The batter was not delicate, lacked taste, and was clearly cooked previously and heated up. Mikuni's in Sacramento   area (several) is the best, and I had hoped this would be a similar experience. Disappointed and not planning to return.

Wait person was prompt, friendly, and apologetic. ","Fun atmosphere.  Huge hibachi area as well as regular dining section as well.  I tried both the spicy tuna maki roll and the salmon hibachi dinner.  On tuesdays from 5-7 pm the maki rolls are half off.  The hibachi dinner includes onion soup, ginger salad, 3 shrimp, rice and noodles.  I enjoyed the entire meal.  It's not the best hibachi meal I've ever had but it did not disappoint me and its a fun dining experience. This place is ideal for groups or second dates."," Service was fast, food was decent.

They Seemed to be focused too much on theatrics and not quality food and service.,"Very good food, atmosphere and service. I recommend the calamari as an appetizer and the Angry Dragon as a main course. The drinks are good. I had a Long Island ice tea and it was very good. I give this place my highest recommendation. For 3 of us it came to $130. Not bad for what we had.",I went here the other day and everything was absolutely perfect. It has everything you could want from a sushi restaurant. They have a very attentive staff that was quick to handle my requests and those of my party.

2S9t90Q0qZWCV7X_u0rxZQ,Generic ramen. Decent service. Back maybe seven ten years ago they were one of the only options around and was good. Nowadays there are better options in the city.," Great, authentic ramen and atmosphere. Very flavourful and satisfying. Also excellent donburi. When they opened.

Unfortunately, over the past few months it feels as though their success has lead to a drop in quality of the food. In addition to this, one of my favourite comfort foods is no longer on the menu - donburi.

Will definitely check in from time to time as even on a bad day they're still one of the better options in the area. "," This used to be the only ramen place on Dundas and now it has been usurped by much better ramen joints. 

Granted, Kenzo showed up first and has retained it's laid back feel while some of the newer ramen restos are crowded and too cool for school.

The noodles at Kenzo are the eggy kind that I dislike. The soup in the tonkotsu ramen is milky like the way it should be. 

The takoyaki balls are pretty good but they (gasp) have gotten smaller! 

Sansotei down the street on the opposite side closer to University Ave is far better tasting and better priced. Go there instead... ","Really bad experiences gained today about the horrible services. It was my friend's birthday. The waiter told us there is no table for 8 ppl after we have waited outside for 15-20 mins. It's ok if there has no big table for big group, but waiter should tell us in the beginning instead of told us to wait. Wtf??? Really upset, never visit again."," Raman soup base doesn't taste good. It's the soul of the Raman, when it's not good the whole Raman is ruined. 
Have to come here because the other Raman place down the street has a long lineup. ","Food was so so but service was suck. Only three table was taken, waiters were sitting behind and chatting. I raised and waved my hand several times and nobody notice. Finally the bill came out with 17% gratuity....They even didn't ask how much tips you like to pay, they just sum up with 17% gratuity. Who wants to pay 17% for that kind of service? Be careful....so not Japanese"," I was there before for they open the store because my greyhound bus arrived early...when they open the door, I immediately ordered the house ramen. To my surprise, it came warm instead of hot, little slices of meat with my noodle soup. And my soup was just too salty so I asked for a cup of tea..but it was a tea bag tea with charge. I was very disappointed in their service. The waitress was busy talking to the guy cook instead of coming to check on my table. I had to walk to her to remind her that I was ready to pay the bill!!  Ridiculous! "," I work about a block away and I always look forward to trying out new places
that are around me, which are numerous.   I've tried most of the places on
this strip and I think Kenzo really stands out.

Excellent soup and great gyoza!!    This place makes some amazing Ramen
and I love going there for lunch time and time again.   

I usually get the Netsu-Ramen (Pork & Egg noodle) and I'll say that I probably
could eat this dish every day.

Great service, and
prices, I just wish the place was a little bigger.","This restaurant is a good place to check out if you want some ramen. The restaurant has a very authentic Japanese ramen shop feel to it. Some of the service isn't the best, but the food at least always comes out good with fresh noodles.

I'll tell you why. Because when it comes to dark chocolate, this is the perfect delivery system. You couldn't get higher off of a chocolate rush if you injected it.*

That is why I did not give it four stars.,Me and my husband love Jamaican food and this place was just recently recommended to us so we decided to try it. We had the jerk chicken (of course!) which was delicious  beef patty the best in Las Vegas and oxtail which didn't disappoint food was absolutely what I was expecting good! So why a 3 stars well because their customer service needs a lot of improvement and that makes me sad because a place with good food like paradise place needed good service to keep people coming back. Now that I know their food is good I might stop and pick something up but not in the near future.," OMG YASS so good i had the oxtails and rum cake 
Really tasty and so tender the rice and beans cooked perfect  i cant wait to try some more dishes  yum yum ill b back again forsure !!

I drove from the east side to the west side for it. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Great atmosphere and absolutely delicious plates. I ordered the ox tail!,"Purchased a Groupon there a little while ago. When we went the server said he needs to make sure if they have met there Groupon quota for the day, when we went it was about 4pm. Highly unprofessional. He didn't want to accept the Groupon and was explaining to us that it didn't make sense for him to have Groupon since it really wasn't a profit. Attitude was really nasty. Walked out and left, for a refund from Groupon.",This place was nothing short of just being incredible!

You are very welcome Paradise Place for the review. I will not be returning. No thank you!!!",I was in the mood for Jamaican food and stopped by.  They definitely provided a delicious meal.  The jerk chicken was to die for.  It was filled with that spicy flavor I love.  The only thing I could complain about was the service.  The staff seemed rude and uncaring.

However, I will never again order a bowl of fresh fruit for $5 because it is just NOT worth it.  The dish was tiny, there was hardly any variety (or fruit, for that matter), and the pineapple was absolutely tasteless.  I've never had worse pineapple in my life, TBH.  But as far as drinks go, my beers were reliable and inexpensive. :)  And apparently my husband's tacos were very, very good.  Service was good, as well.",Ambiance is a bit sterile and simple. Service was excellent however and there was a good view of all the TVs regardless of where you sat.

The hostesses aren't the smartest bunch of girls in the world, ya know the type that's watching a basketball game and screams ""touchdown"". 


The food was OK, it wasn't so bland that I wouldn't be back but not great enough that I'm making sure we make time to stop in again. "," This is my favorite Majerle's! I haven't been to the one in Scottsdale yet but I haven't been disappointed with Marjele's. 

Marjele's in Goodyear is bigger than the one downtown but you can expect the same quality: good food, good drinks, great TVs, and great times! ","Tried Majerle's for the first time while in town for Spring Training and the food was great! My sister and I both and had burgers and were surprised by how large they were. The burger was excellent but the sweet bun really put it over the top. I would've given Majerle's only 4 stars but we had such excellent service.

Much love to Janie. She was amazing and didn't even mind that we were both dressed in Oakland A's jerseys, lol. Sweet, attentive, and awesome. Did I mention cute? She's cute. Thanks for the great service."," This is a very average sports bar. 

Strawberry chicken salad was tasty, but chicken was tough and over cooked and mixed greens had way too many browning pieces of lettuce. The candied pecans were delicious, though. 

Sliders meat to bun ratio wasn't good. Too much bread. Although they grill the buns in butter to try to make up for it. 

Thumbs up on the potato skins. 

Service was reaaaaaaaaally slow, even though they weren't that busy. "," While my boyfriend is in town for Nascar , he and his team stay down the street at a hotel near this bar and grill. Looking for nightlife options midweek this is what we found. Not bad! We sat at the bar. I ordered my famous snakebite... and yeah.. they had to ask, but they did it and it came out very well. Had to have two since they opened two ciders and two guinness to make the drink. Good music.. some nights there is karaoke. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The quesadilla on the appetizer menu is shareable and became a craveable favorite of my boyfriend and myself. Good bar!","The food here is great, and is a good value for your money.

They only use the best ingredients between their freshly baked breads. You can choose from Ciabatta, Pumpernickel, Italian, Sourdough, white, wheat and many more. ","I do not know what an authentic Brooklyn deli is like but this place has some good fresh food and nice employee's. I always get the Country Dijon egg salad and I am never disappointed. I have had others, the turkey and a salad which both tasted great. I have never had a complaint about the food, every time the it tastes great.

We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. 

The place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container.

Check out their daily specials too! ",I went to this place for late night food so there was not a whole lot of choice that I knew of.  The food was your typical bar food.  It was nothing spectacular but I would go back if I had to for some food.  One thing that was funny...my buddy tried to order Negro Modelo since there were signs advertising this beer and it was no longer available.,My only experience at Gallagher's was similar to the one described below by Glenn G.  Went there with a large group from work and found the service to be excellent.  Everyone enjoyed the food.  Rarely do you have a large party (we had about 10) and request separate checks without getting attitude; but here they were happy to do so.  Based on this visit I would recommend Gallagher's.," Very disappointed today.  Stopped in for some wings and drinks. Apparently management decided to send some staff home for lack of traffic. Unfortunately there were not enough staff to take care of the customers that did show up. After waiting far too long, had to go to the bar multiple times to order and deliver our own drinks. This was a problem a year ago and it seemed management got the message and service became very good. Don't know if this is going to continue but it does will be returning very often.

This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees.

They also make GREAT drinks.,"I love sushi, and maybe I'm a little bit of a snob about it living in California for 11 years. But I just can't get down with this place after trying it a couple times. 
The sushi is cut very thickly and has a very bland taste. Which I guess is better than a fishy taste, but it's just not good on the palate. Maybe it's the distance the fish has to travel. But I've been to a couple other sushi places in Ohio and they were a lot better. 
It's probably in part the sushi chef's knife skills. It seems like it's trying hard to be cool. It misses the mark for me."," In town for a business meeting and wanted sushi.  A quick walk from the hotel.  It was a quite Thursday night so I practically had the place to myself.  The choices were plenty and when I asked if they could make a Christmas Tree roll, the chef did not hesitate.  It was very good.  I enjoyed the Rainbow roll also.  The waitress was very helpful in  suggesting some of Sushi Rock's special rolls.  Definetly will visit when I am in town again.

My work colleague had his food come out literally 20 minutes after everyone else had already finished their meal. To top it off, most of the dishes were mediocre at best, especially the sushi, which had generous portions but was not good enough to justify the price.  The filet mignon was good however.","What can I say....its sushi. They've been around for years. Weds you need a reservation for half priced sushi night. A few of my favorites are the Big Mouth (spicy), Spider (soft shell crab) and Caterpillar.  Sounds funky but they are the big rolls.

"," Just happened to pass by the place tonight and decided to give it a try.  My wife had the goulash and I had the pork with cream mushroom dish.  Both were extremely fresh and very good!   The dinner salad was OK, but I say that only because I don't like frilly salads like theirs (with dandelion, etc.). The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.  It feels like a family owned type of place, where a lot of love and hard work was put into it.  It's not easy to spot and it's made even more difficult to find because they have outdoor screens covering their storefront...can't tell they are open.  I would definitely recommend...  Very good! "," Went with hubby try it out. He used to work in a German restaurant, so he was a little more critical about the food. He kept telling me how things ""should"" have been done.  We both thought it was overpriced, under portioned. We were the only ones in the restaurant  (other than staff) the night we went, which should have been a warning to us. Everything was meh.
We did enjoy the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream, but hated to hear the microwave door slam shut before the strudel arrived at our table.
I wonder how long they will be in business...so sad cause we love local mom/pop restaurants. "," I was dying to try this place being of German/Polish decent, boy was I disappointed! Hubby had the German Bockwurst & fries, it was like a giant boiled hot dog, fries OK. I had the Schnitzel Vienna Style, the pork was very dried out, no taste. Now I have eaten quite a few potato pancakes in my day, my mom used to grate them by hand, and fry them in a pan. These were like the took leftover mashed potato formed them into a patty and deep fried them! MUSHY!  Needless to say my long awaited adventure clear across town was a bust, save your money! "," New customer lost to greedy owner.
First visit today for a quick lunch.  Ice tea came, my wife took one sip and said she did not like it and  sent it back and only had water.  Schnitzel was bland and Beer Bratwurst was sub-par.  The lentil soup however was delicious.  Check came with charge for tea which I questioned and was told that owner said she had a sip so we had to pay for it!!!  You've got to be kidding...will now not go back. Also, pre-packaged yellow mustard in a German restaurant. ",What a hidden gem. You can tell every dish is homemade. The food service and everything about this place is worth 6 plus stars. I highly recommend and will be coming back!!,"This place is not a good experience. The food is sub-par and mediocre, and the attitude of the owner is something that is a disappointment. The price is way too much for the quality of the food is much to be desired. It is not really authentic like it should be.

The customer service was great and my daughter liked it too. will be coming back.,This was my first time and I was a bit worried. But my eyebrows turned out awesome!

You are the best.," My sister and I came here looking for a new place to get our eyebrows done! We were so satisfied with the job done here. Priya (I hope that's how its spelled) is wonderful! Very sweet, and she is very gentle when working on sensitive areas such as the eyebrows and upper lip area. She was honest about the shape of my brows and gave suggestions about how to improve them. Usually it's a painful experience to get my eyebrows threaded, but it didn't hurt one bit here! Makes me wonder what the other places I've been going to have been doing to me this whole time. Love it, will return. ",Nari is amazing. I had a horrible experience at eyebrows r us and she got my eyebrows back to looking amazing :) I highly recommend her!," I was looking for a new eyebrow place close to my house and came across them on Yelp. The places is very clean and organized  and they also sell really nice purses. I went to Priya and she was AMAZING! She took her time and shaped my eyebrows very nicely. I have a natural arch and she made them even better. She also gave me tips on growing them out thicker and longer and even used a ""brow mascara"" that filled them in very nicely.

Insane topping bar.,"From 3-6pm they have 2$ fish tacos, they come bare but have a condiment bar with everything you need. French fries were perfect and the fish was great!",The fish tacos are exceptional. Best I've ever had!!!  Will definitely go back for Taco Tuesday!!!  Love this place.,"Got fish tacos. I noticed they batter and fry their own fish which you just won't see at most fast dinning restaurants. The tacos are served plain but there is a toppings bar with just about all you could want. For the fish tacos especially I loved the slaw and the not-from-a-can/jar tartar sauce with just a drizzle of the very hot sauce. I will definitely go here again!

5 stars based on it being exemplary in it's category of fast-casual food. Definitely up there with some other recent novel additions in this category in the Phoenix area (like fast casual pitas/hummus bowls).","Pros: The food was cooked and served quickly. Plenty of meat in the tacos. They are served plain (just meat and tortilla) and then you get to help yourself to the salsa bar. Out of the 3 tacos I tried (Carne Asada, Surf & Turf, Full) I enjoyed the Carne Asada most. The beef of the Carne Asada taco and the Surf and Turf tacos were well seasoned.

Cons: I'm not a huge fan of the battered layer on the fish and shrimp. However, I will be back for their Carne Asada tacos! Also, the bathroom doesn't have mirrors, but that's besides the point.",Really good fish & shrimp tacos.  Quick and easy place to grab a bite.  My kids loved it my hubby loved it that combo for me an A+,Not from this part of town. A local recommended this newly opened place. I was very impressed with the fish taco...generous serving of lightly battered fish - topping bar had many options. I got to dress it My Way!!  They have Taco Tuesday buy two get one Free!!,I love Tortilla Fish.  Anytime we are in the area we go. I always order too much because I want one of each.  The full taco is my favorite!  The home made ranch with the French fries is also hard to beat.,"I came here in the mood for some fish tacos because I heard the place was great.  I must admit, this place is as good as its reputation.  Their fish tacos were delicious!  They also have some really good shrimp tacos.

I had 1/4 lb burger with American cheese, green chile, 1000 Island Dressing and pickles. The family who owns it are very friendly. I highly recommended this place.","I am a gourmet chef and in general I'm pretty hard on restaurants.  The food has to be at least as good as I make at home.  Well, I tell ya, Lucky's burgers beat mine by a long shot.  I tried Lucky's for the first time yesterday and I have to say that Lucky's burgers are better tasting than any of the chain burgers, even 5Guys.  The place was CLEAN! The staff was very friendly and helpful."," Best burger I've had in a long time.
Try the double and load it up with bacon.  The charbroiled taste is like right off the grill.  Frys are seasoned and cooked perfect.   Will be back for sure.

Eat here. Owner runs the place with her father cooking. Sweet.," Finally stopped in here. The menu has burgers, dogs, gyros, fries and shakes. Thats about it. The green chili burgers, fries and banana shake are all great. The staff (both of them) were friendly and quick. Its a tiny place but its clean and efficient! A burger will run you about what a whopper does but its better. Don't hesitate to try this place! Oh, there's no public restrooms btw...so plan accordingly. ","Staff here is friendly and helpful, tried this place twice and will not be coming back. 

The first time I tried the 1/4 burger and it tasted alright but it tasted like a burger king burger.

Went back a second time a got a meal. The fries were excellent and cooked perfectly. The burger was a huge disappointment. It was extremely greasy and didn't taste great. In-n-out has much better burgers and half the cost.",If you are in the mood for the best burger around then head to Lucky's right now.

Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people. The owner Pete is awesome as well. All the waiters, waitresses, bar tenders, and of course Pete make you feel like family who just got home. It's an absolutely wonderful place to go. BE SURE TO TRY A DARK AND STORMY DOWN THERE! ","In loooove. Especially with the frites (and that aioli?!) and the southwestern Caesar salad - it tastes like guacamole and a Caesar salad mixed together. Amazing. Service is always attentive and friendly. Prices are reasonable, too; I got a great, filling lunch with a friend for $10 each."," Good coctail. Service was awesome. I had the polenta. Pretty good. I'm not sure how the polenta was cooked... little mealy. I would've preferred it be pan fried or something. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich. He said it was good, especially the bacon aioli. "," Met a few friends for dinner last night- we were seated right away, but it was very early.  As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind.  
The menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish.  The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine.  Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often. "," Best burger I've had in Madison - loved that the bread is more of a brioche than a bun.  Service was friendly and prompt.  My only wish is that they turned the volume on the tvs down a bit.  Yes, they're showing European football matches, so it's better than your average bar, but a little less volume would go a long way. ","This place is so-so.  The food was ok, I had the steak frites. It was about 6 slices of a small steak and just blah fries topped with a strange sweet sauce(not sure why). My partner had a vege special with chanterelle mushrooms that was really well seasoned. The bone marrow app was under seasoned and just blah again. I found the service super slow and the place too loud for my tastes. Overall, Brasserie V is way, way better!  Rather spend my money there."," I heard great things about it, but it was only ok for me. I had a chicken sandwich and it wasn't terrible, but the chicken was clearly processed. It is also VERY noisy inside. However my wife really liked her salad and they have a good beer selection. "," My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry - I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it.  On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg - and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth.

Beer - yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?","It's not as amazing as some people say. Not saying it's bad, because it's actually really good, but not the best ever. There's quite a lot of variety here in foods, from burgers, to sandwiches, to guacamole and salads. Pretty much everything you'd expect. The food quality is good, and service is fast, but they definitely cut corners by using processed foods. Not all fresh.

Expected prices to be too high for me but they are really fair. Medium coffee is $2 and lattes are $3-4. It's also great to support the new business. Highly recommend trying this out and supporting the local business.," Excellent coffee/espresso. Happy he's finally got his own show to run. Hope he has an excellent, long run. The coffee community is better with Braden in it.

That said, I'd love for anyone complaining about the quality of Crazy Mocha's Oakland shop to say that to Emily's face, lol.

Disclaimer: Have known Braden for years, back with TdO and EaM. And I currently work for Crazy Mocha. "," Certainly a delicious coffe, and very friendly people. 
Cool spot! "," Can't believe there is an independent and FRIENDLY coffee shop in Oakland! Not snobby at all-- nice and light inside, they will toast bagels for you, serious about coffee-- roasted in Lancaster PA. Oat milk and almond milk options. "," If you haven't checked out this coffee place yet, you absolutely have to! Very conveniently located  near all of the major hospitals in Oakland, it's one of the best coffee places in town. The owners are extremely nice and knowledgeable. I'm thrilled to have a great coffee shop in Oakland, and I'm especially lucky to have it right next to my office! It is also very reasonably priced. The coffee is unbelievably good, so support the local business! "," Amazing coffee, wonderful service, great treats. Best coffee shop in Pittsburgh. "," This coffee was so good! I got the cold brew which comes in a glass bottle. A little pricey but it is so smooth. There was no need for any type of milk/creamer. The only downside is that there isn't much seating so it's more of a grab and go type coffee shop. It's also a little hidden and if you don't know where you're going, you may miss it! (Hint: it's next to the donut shop.) I'll surely be back.

The parking situation is metered street parking. It's fine if you work or live in the area, then you can just walk and not have to deal with that hassle. ",Great coffee great atmosphere and super friendly staff.  Nice place to visit along the college strip. Check em out.,"Has the best coffee in town. Well, maybe not the best, but absolutely yummy.

During the transaction, the staff realized the sign they posted for the .40 caliber ammo was incorrect.  Instead of offering me the ammo at the advertised price, they promptly removed the sign and said we would have to pay more for the ammo.

The octopus (FYI not local! Despite the ""everything local"" them the restaurant goes for) was chewy and didn't have any flavor. It was hard to get through it all (sorry for being harsh!) 

The place has a cute feel to it so I'll give it that!","This restaurant is a great place to check out if you're in the mood for some vegetarian food.

Rented a car for a ~400 mile roundtrip excursion.  Cheapest rates by far. No wait when I picked up my car on a Saturday, car was as promised.

Make sure you read what you sign! The contract I was presented when picking up the car had a .50 charge per mile over 100 a day, while the terms I agreed to online said unlimited.  I had them cross that off and initial it before I agreed to sign.

The lounge is also nice, and I love free soda.","I reserved my rental car through Travelocity and I was thoroughly pleased.

I found them through Kayak and then booked a prepaid reservation directly on the Sixt site. The price was right - $49/day for three days' rental of a BMW 328i.

","Possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to in town. Most of the employees that have served me barely put anything in my bowls. I asked for a little bit more steak, and the lady literally scoops out 1 piece of steak. Cheese? They sprinkle that on there like it's the last bucket of cheese they have for the next month. And the guacamole? Guac is extra, so I expect at least a proper scoop. She gives me half a scoop. Seriously?

And they will not make quesadilla style burritos during lunch rush (lame).",i like getting the 3 taco combo here. the salsa is so flavorful! i like getting the bowls too. heck.. i like everything here! the only downside is you gotta eat really fast or get a separate basket for the tacos cuz they get really soggy at the bottom from the juice from the meat and salsa. they get so soggy the taco comes apart before you bite into it. but if you can get it into your mouth without the insides falling out from the split.. kudos!," Below standard, even for Chipotle. Rice was not cooked all the way. Food was lukewarm. Salsas were flavorless(maybe not fresh?) Pretty disappointing.","Chipotle is normally a high quality fast food restaurant where you can get high quality burritos and chicken/rice bowls.  This particular Chipotle however, is anything but high quality.  They don't give you enough food to eat.  The food they do give you to eat is stale or old.  Even if its not old food, they way they give it to you is usually very sloppy.

Great place for family fun," I've been here a few times now, and I love it! Definitely fun for a date or just something to do. My only complaint is that either each obstacle for each hole are longer or create more holes! One round goes by too quickly! Plan on possibly going this Sunday for a double date! "," This place is definitely worth the price. They give you a glow in the dark bracelet to start, and you have the chance to win a free round on the last hole. There were a lot of kids there, but as an adult I didn't feel out of place at all. The setup is great inside and I love the little extra touches, like the wheel you spin at one hole that gives you challenges to complete and the ball charging stations. My only complaint is that it got pretty warm in there. Otherwise everything was fine. ","We just visited this place over the weekend for the first time. We used a groupon for $20.00 me, my husband and two kids could golf! That was a great deal! The place is a little small ans could be a bit cleaner but overall we had a blast and the glow in the dark theme is a great idea!"," We recently went here on my son's bday. The kids thought it was super cool and the courses were fun and challenging. Also, being able to charge your golf ball was so neat to them. Will be back in the future.",This was a really cool place for the kids to enjoy.  The glow in the dark atmosphere is something unique that will leave them with their jaws dropped!

I have gotten their medium one topping only $9.48 +tax which is perfect for just the two of us, its always hot, delicious, a bit greasy(which makes it good) and has the best cheese, to bread, to meat, to crust ratio out of any pizza I have had.

I paid extra for a fried egg and it was cooked over hard, I didn't know I needed to specify that it should be over easy. The burger had no flavor. The sweet potatoes fries were good but a little under cooked. The staff was very friendly and attentive but the food was underwhelming.

I think for the first few days of being in operation that they are doing a great job. Both times I was there were not lunch hours so maybe that's why my experience was different than the other negative reviewers.

Great beer list, wine. Reasonable prices. Friendly people. Patio. Score! Check it out. ","Fun little spot for burgers and sandwiches. We stopped in for a late lunch after a trip to Edgewater Park. It's only about a half mile away so a perfect stop after the beach. We had our dog with us so sat on the patio, which was perfect. We enjoyed a mix of sandwiches and burgers and we're pleased with the vegetarian and vegan options offered. Everything was huge, especially the burgers which were really thick. For sides, the sweet potato fries and 3 bean salad were clear winners.

In our party of 5 we all ordered something different and each and everyone of us was blown away by the taste, freshness and size of it all! This is a place that you need to come back time and time again to get the full experience. Not to mention the friendliness of the staff and the quickness in which the food was prepared. Along with the food they also have a wide variety of beer to perfectly pair with your meal (and they don't silently judge you for getting a beer with your early lunch!)."," Freshness at it's finest. I admit that I don't eat here often, even though it's only a block from my house. I don't do fast casual that often. However, when I do get in there, it is always right on the mark for what I craved. The folks who work there are always nice, and when the weather permits, their patio is a great spot to eat and hang out.","The best thing about this place is the fact that there's something for everyone.  If you have a group of friends that are vegetarian, they have stuff on the menu.  If you have heavy meat eater friends, there are lots of amazing burger options.

There is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is very expensive but if you use the Internet you can find a budgetary way of paying for it. It's worth it. 

No long walks...at all. Elevator to pool? Your there. Elevator to casino? Your there. 

Trust me people. Stay here. I'll never stay at another hotel in Vegas after this weekends  experience.  And I'm kind of poor. "," Exactly what you would expect of the Four Seasons, clean and comfortable rooms, friendly staff, excellent food and amenities.

The only negative is the pool is a little on the small side...but you have access to Mandalay Bay and their pools. "," Beautiful hotel! Really enjoyed my stay. The presidential suit is gorgeous! Great hotel to stay in if you want something in the strip, but not in a casino. The rooms are awesome and the staff is amazing. Definitely would stay here again.

Would absolutely recommend!," Great new alternative to Chipotle, and a lot more to offer here.  Great food, very reasonably priced and interesting modern design elements in the interior.  Fortunately for us, it's also close to home. We will definitely be back. "," Chipotle has nothing on this place! It is a build your own burrito at the counter style place, but with so many more options. Tons of different meats and salsa to choose from. The spicy avocado salsa is amazing! And the nachos. Man those nachos! Ask for a frequent buyers card so you can get discounts. I was very impressed with the service as well. They were very friendly and seemed to enjoy their job, which you typically don't see in fast food style places like this.  And lastly, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are generous. I could not finish my burrito bowl in one setting. Leftover were just as good!","I really like this place.  its a great way to get some healthy mexican style food at a good price.

The Galbi and Bulgogi was delicious (tender and juicy) along with the a generous portion of the spicy squid.  Price is comparable and usual like other korean restaurants.  The only thing maybe have more of a variety of banchan (two of them were seaweed wrap). "," If you are a asian, you must try this restaurant. The tofu soup with seafood is so good!

I didn't care for one of the sides, but seriously, I LOVED everything else. I will definitely be going there again, maybe this time I will go in person. I would highly recommend the spicy tofu soup, it was delectable. I can't stop craving it!! ",Great place to get your Korean cravings satisfied in southern Arizona.  The place was busy and they carry your standard Korean dishes.  The side dishes were alright but better than none.," We come here often after having lived in Korea for over a year. 

I love the yu kei chong and the bulgogi. In wife gets dolsot and bipimbop. The Kimchi is excellent. They've got the Korean OB beer. 

Highly recommend. "," This is my benchmark for Bulgogi even after I moved back to Silicon Valley, where there are a ton of Korean restaurants. They also serve excellent tofu soup and cold noodles. "," Awesome service and attentive.  Authentic Korean, the best tofu soup.  This is my go-to place especially when I'm not well.   Nothing like a steaming bowl of spicy goodness to warm yourself up.

I had the bruschetta to eat and it was a huge filling portion. It was OK. Nothing extraordinary to write about. ",Simple bar and grill with a simple menu. I recommend the salmon sliders and the tater tots.,One hour wait for mediocre food.  But at least the place pumps uber loud music so everyone had to scream to be heard.,"Great place to watch games.  Had about five tvs.  The best thing at bar louie is there 4-7pm weekday happy hour.  I wish they offered a late night happy hour also.
The drinks on regular menu as well as food is overpriced for the quality.  The chicken nachos were stale.  The fatheads bumble berry small was over 6$.  So i'd probably only go here for happy hour.","The bar area was packed on a friday evening and I met a group of about 12 girls for a bday celebration.  The waitress was sooooo slow and never checked on us and messed up our drink order repeatedly.  We would have to actually go and look for her when we needed something.  We ordered about 7 apps for the table and although they were good, it did not make up for the lackluster service.  If your in for drinks and people watching then its ok but wouldn`t go out of my way to come here again.",Went for lunch today on my lunch break with some work friends. It took them 40 mins for them to get our food. During this time we asked for it to get our food in boxes-because at this point it took 80% of our break to even get the food. Not once did our server apologize for the ridiculous wait or even let us know what was going on in the kitchen. Keep in mind we ordered very basic menu items.  Once the food finally came out it was mediocre at best. Never going back-especially for lunch.,"This place is hit or miss. The food, when it's timely and correct, is pretty great. Good drinks too. But on more than one occasion, the service has been terrible. We actually had a serve get fired in the middle of serving us! Recommend that you sit at the bar and order drinks. It you're determined to eat, make sure it's not when they are crowded!

**Update**
I can't make this up. Went to Bar Louie for brunch on 9/10. The cook messed up our order of omelettes TWICE!!!! And the coffee was cold. I am done with this location.","I've given this place several chances before giving up completely. We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders literally ignore us. There's no way you don't see me and my guests sitting, without drinks. And it's never super busy when we have gone in! Your bartenders need to learn to at least acknowledge - a very basic customer service trait. When you finally do revive a drink, it sits empty forever! I spent years tending bar and would never treat guests this way. 

Ps - had a group of 8 girlfriends wanting to go tonight and I warned them not to because your service is horrendous. They went to Cheesecake instead.",The staff here are slow and at times ignore the customers. The food and drinks are nothing to write home about and are pretty over priced.

The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!," Chapalas is a great mexican restaurant. The staff are very friendly and welcoming upon arrival. The seating is very good and there is enough space that you do not feel cramped. My family and I usually go on Sunday's when they have the buffet. The food is always fresh and they are quick to restock if an item is low. Generally, buffet food is something left to be desired, but not at Chapalas. My family and I will keep coming here as long as it is open! I definitely recommend this restaurant. ",If I could give this place less then one star I would! It's not very often I rate something this low just because I give points for effort but it's like this place stopped caring and started serving crap! I ordered a taco chili relleno and enchilada combo the only edible item on my plate was the enchilada.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it came on a not a fajita plate just a regular plate with lettuce and pico it was a very sad excuse for a fajita meal!

Our server was abrupt and unfriendly. I got a beef burrito but was surprised when it came out with no sauce on top (it was just a simple tortilla with beef and beans in it). It would have been very plain had I not poured some of the chip salsa on top. My friend got a shrimp dish which he thought was decent. ",I gave it one star only because the service was excellent. The mild salsa is tomatoe sauce with chili powder. The hot salsa is mild enough for a Midwesterner. They put VegAll in EVERYTHING! Seriously? Potatoes and Lima Beans in Tamales? Carrots and Corn in taco meat? I'm frankly embarrassed they are even in business. It is a great dishonor to a fine cuisine that I love dearly. Great service but the food is horrendous. Do not waste your time and money. Honestly?

For any indian origin...pure soul food.

Extensive vegetarian menu. Generous portions, attentive service and super reasonable prices. ",Really disappointed.  Lousy food and bad attitude of the server.    Half of us after coming back to the hotel are having an upset stomach.,Rava masala dosa was great.  Saag paneer was average.  Paratha was not very good.  Masala chai was way over priced for a small cup at $3.50.  This is a good place to eat after visiting the temple since its only about a mile away.  But for food and ambiance I'd not make the trip here.  It is good for strict vegetarians since they do not serve any meat here.," Best Indian food within a day's drive.

Might I recommend the chana batura? Paneer dosa? And perhaps begin with the potato bonda?

Sometimes humble surroundings beget fine food. Enjoy!","This place is the place to go if you want to taste good authentic Indian food.  Although it can be crowded at times, the wait is worth it.

We really liked all of the homemade tortillas, and we'll be back!  Waitstaff was delightful.","Oh wow, this place is amazing. Food here is way above what you'd expect. It's not in the biggest area with foot traffic, so it's a bit hidden, but you know what they say, hidden gems are the best.

4DVqziHGABcYUUw_E36c5g,"This is a nice little aquarium located right at the flats district. It's the only one of it's kind in Cleveland. As far as aquariums go though, this is not at par with the likes of the New England Aquarium. Think Mandalay Bay hotel aquarium in Las Vegas, which is similar in size.

I echo the sentiments of most reviewers regarding cost and the flats still looking shady. Overall, I think it is an impressive effort, I love it, would love to see it going and would be more than glad to support it. ",We had a great time at the Greater Cleveland Aquarium.  The exhibits are well done and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  We visited mid-week when there were smaller crowds.," The Greater Cleveland Aquarium is a nice place to spend a couple of hours in the downtown Cleveland/Flats area.  It is expensive, in my opinion for what is actually there.  It is family friendly, and children enjoy it.  The building is really cool - and sharks are always fascinating,  You can touch a ray, have fish, sharks and rays swim over your head in the tunnels, and also feed the rays - but be mindful of feeding times.  Costumed staff/tour guides add to the charm factor.  The gift shop has a nice assortment of souvenirs. ","Love love love! We almost didn't go because it's 20.00 a person and we kept hearing it wasn't worth it, but it was worth it!  The shark tank was amazing! You can walk through a tunnel and they swim right over you. We were taking shark selfies!  They have a really nice touch tank and an amazing jellyfish display.   It's a very relaxing place.  The staff are knowledgable (ask about the poor turtles).   We had a great time today. Even our 8 month old liked it.","The wife and I took the family. I expected it to grade out to be an F. The difference in price between a season pass or a day pass(for a family of 5) was $80. Either way, it's not worth it. My kids called it a ""Pet Co. On steroids!""  the under water tunnel and petting area was cool. Other than that, it is like a pet store you pay $35 to get in to. Factoring in the tunnel and sting ray petting, I give it an overall D!! 
Save you time and money and visit Great Lakes Brewing (down the street)!"," Very cool. Went for the Nauti By Nature Yelp Party! Fantastic time!! Love the fishes, sharks, turtles and sting ray petting tank! ","I visited during shark weekend, so there were shark-themed activities like sidewalk chalk, pictures, a show and tell guy (shark teeth, sting ray bar, etc).

Parking was $5.

The shark tank is cool and there's a tunnel where you walk through it. Now there are lounge chairs in the petting area. 

It's a small place. I walked through the entire thing in an hour and I probably read like 10 info plates.

It will be great in a few years, with the expansions.","Get the tour!!!! It's not advertised well, but they have a tour for $10 more that is SO awesome. You learn all kinds of stuff that you never would have known, & they take you back behind the scenes. If you don't do the tour, it's your basic mid-level aquarium. Don't miss out!","The staff here are friendly, engaging, and knowledgeable. It's a bit expensive but the exhibits are well done, and there are chances to interact with some of the animals. You can feed the stings rays, and touch them too! The sharks can swim right over the top of you via an overhead tunnel, it's a great view. If you want more informative experience you can pay for a tour.",CWUo0MH3XZR_c-O_nOtF8g,UDms4SSijxj2Mkly8ZFmeQ,gmOsNtQ7-OfFS22n9nnDng,WVmuRG9Ohn_9vy9DWmNyQQ,IFHBMw3QeJUikdR7lWuJGw,GXIxqFrVF22WZ0lm6LATYA,BVccGoqgjIJpruZ4LMJsXg,2RfVzb9fB5i2O8Y2OEQpoQ

They do electronic prescription, which was very handy by the time I got to my cvs I walked up and picked it up with no problem and in a matter of time. "," At first they seemed like an excellent choice, and then I started noticing their dirty billing tricks! A few patients came in demanding a reason why they were being billed twice by the DR. And their insurance company. I didn't believe it! Not until the office tried to do the same to me and stated I'd contact my insurance company to refund me what they were trying to charge. I called my insurer, who stated this was NOT how things worked. My Insurance rep contacted them for a refund for me, and reported them to the board. 

They provided great service but their billing practices are very questionable...read the poor reviews, there's plenty of truth in them. ","Stay away from this doctor and don't believe to all of these good reviews. He buys these reviews for $5 Starbucks gift cards. This doctor wants only money and don't care about your health. He is looking for most expensive ways of treatment. He pushed me to surgery trying to get more money from that.

The doctor answers all questions and explains everything to ensure you understand.,"This was my first time getting an annual exam in over 20 years (I know, I know) the doctor and staff made me feel very comfortable and at ease.

I am extremely glad I was referred here and will be going for regular visits now. Thank you, Nicole",Clean office with a friendly an inviting environment. The staff is very sweet and organized. Dr. Luis J Lopez was very patient and knowledgeable about all my concerns and questions. This was my first appointment with them and the in-processing paperwork took only a few minutes. I would recommend him to everyone.,"This doctor is great at providing some professional care and has a helpful team as well. The team works hard to make sure that you feel comfortable and understands how some people have some initial reservations and fears about going to doctors.

Bars are great and pricing for gambling are cheap.,"Stayed here a few times and will every time in the future! Screw the Strip at $250/per night and extra $25 fridge rental. Here it's all included: vault, fridge in a spacious, quiet room with nice golf course view. There's Starbucks, deli, Fridays, seafood restaurant, bowling, theatre, spa, gym, etc. Best part is it's $60 a night without the strip traffic. I can't justify the higher priced Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio. Rather have that money for dining, shopping, massages and spa treatments. Can't wait for my next trip!"," We stayed here for one of our weekend getaways and we loved it. We had a room with a view of the golf course, which turned out to be better than expected. We could see a lot of Las Vegas from our room. The bathroom was big and had a huge walk i shower, but no tub. Overall, definitely worth the stay. "," I found the air quality in the casino to be very, very bad. The smell of smoke was overwhelming except near the table games by the valet parking door. Breakfast was tasty and well priced., but the smell of smoke lingered there as well.
Other casinos in Vegas do it much better. This place is far away from anything, though there is mall going up across the street. 
Given a choice, I'd 'donate' my money elsewhere. ","Worst buffet I've had in a long time. Since I bowl here, I will occasionally have lunch here.  It's usually pretty mediocre. Today we went to practice our bowling, then decided to have lunch. It was the so-called Sunday brunch. It was almost $29 for two. Every dish we tried was cold. The place was busy too. You'd think it would be at least warm with so much turnover.  Very poor management.",Not a Fancy Hotel but has a good casino and clean rooms..... and a great price.. I would go again," Rooms are huge! Very clean and comfortable, great views, here for business, highly recommend! ","We walked in through here to get to Cafe Sienna.

The exterior of the building is quite nice and this place is pretty big.

As soon as you enter the smell of cigarette smoke and the sound of the slot machines hits you.. .ting ting ting ting.. you know you are in Vegas!

They are open 24/7 - gambling and food!

The crowd here was much older, enjoying drinks, meals and gambling.

This wouldn't be my kinda casino to stay it but decent enough.","Hit or miss. It's a casino, so it stinks of smoke.  Buffet is kinda bad and way overpriced for what you get, which isn't that great to begin with. Rooms here are clean if you're staying in the hotel but they aren't fancy or anything.

On this trip we spent most of our time in the women's shoe section. I loved that if you wanted to try on a shoe, they just scanned the code & then someone came out with your size. However, it didn't seem to take any less time than if the floor associate had just gone and gotten them themselves. 

I've been to plenty of Macy's that have looked run down and in need of a facelift but this location looked great.

You can choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. I got the bowl and asked for half greens and half brown rice. I wasn't a fan of how they made you pick a pre-made poke bowl because it didn't allow you to create your own creation. Also, I felt like my bowl was drenched in too much sauce.

Might as well be called a poke place. Not worth venturing out for. "," After watching the show ""O"" at the Bellagio we stopped in to have a late meal. I had the summer special Acapulco bowl. It had flavor and the jalapeÃ±o had a strong kick, washed it down with Asashi beer. It was extremely tasty and satisfying for the sushi crave. ",I ordered the Redondo burrito like so many other Yelpers and it was fantastic.  I was watching them make the burritos and they put so much in them that even though it comes out small it is very hearty meal.  I also ordered a side of miso soup which had huge chunks of tofu in it.  The staff was extremely friendly and my food came out fast.

Bad form JaBurritos...bad form indeed!"," Sushi burritos are becoming quite the thing in Vegas; between them and poke places, there are an abundance of options around. I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi.

I've ordered the Chicago style but thin crust with steak, mushroom, onions, with tomato sauce, cheese blend and sirracha drizzle is my favourite. Not open for lunch and hardly any where to sit. Calling ahead to place your order is recommended. "," Awesome pizza shop with great employees that greeted us happily and made sure we were helped when we were ready. They have an epic wall full of choices and a fun instructional on how to create an order. We opted for the 'fresh Greek' deep dish and man they went all out on the toppings and the cheese was super stringy without the grease! Overall the food was delicious, super filling so try going in on an empty stomach!  It is definitely a go to place and not a hidden gem anymore (obviously it's too good to be a secret) so be aware that it gets busy and spacing for dining in is limited. ","Beats pizza pizza anytime of the day! oh wait, I guess anything beats that place so it's not much of a complliment.

Been coming back to this place since summer 2011. Amazing pizza( tons of choices), reasonable prices, exeptional service."," This was my first deep dish experience and it did not disappoint. The baby size looks small but it's incredibly filling. This isn't a place I'd hit up regularly, as it's fairly pricey, but I'll definitely be back next time I need to satisfy a craving for deep dish pizza! ",They have deep deep dish pizza   just like Chicago    just  closer to home.     They got all the toppings your want.    And cheese fries   that are so   good,Amazing pizza. Amazing ingredients. Halal option. Garlic bowl is killer. Probably should not eat from here more than once a year :p," Where do i begin on this!! The deep dish pizza here is AMAZING! I haven't actually had the real thing but this pizza here.... Let me tell you its freaking amazing! The toppings.... the crust.. the sauce and the SIZE! Literally could have died and went to heaven right after eating a slice! I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce... It's almost too good to be true! 

The only downside... It's quite far :( Although I will definitely come back here! Since I LOVE pizza!","I've gotta say, their pizza is absolutely amazing. I can't really fault anything about this place. Their deep dish pizza is awesome. All I can say is that while their pizza sizes, especially deep dish might look small, it does not disappoint on flavor and filling. They really are deep dish.

0ihQJhd_-nUP1p01NBDjLQ,"I just ate here for the first and last time. I had a gyro and side of rice. when my food was ready I took it outside to eat with my Rotti as the patio is dog friendly. as soon as I looked at my food I knew I made a mistake eating here. there was a long black hair on the top of my food. the gyro meat was paper thin and totally dried out like it had been sliced off hours ago and had a bad greasy taste to it. the rice was odd, yellow and very small grain. it tasted ok so I ate it. I won`t be back ! ",Everything from the service to the flavors was on point. Initially thought to try it out based on other reviews and was not disappointed. Will certainly be back again :)," Awesome food! very authentic, coming from MI, I've had it all over the place and this is right on par!  Tried their vegetarian falafel and dipitizer (roasted red pepper and jalapeno hummus). Couldn't of had a better combo.  the GF always requests it when im in the area. nice and clean and the owner is really cool and down to earth. "," Stopped here yesterday and got take-out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something.  I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe. ",The jalapeno hummus was very good and a little spicy. The pita chips that came with it were nice and soft and warm. I had the chicken shawarma and the chicken was very delicious as was the sauce. I think this place will do well.,"Nice small family owned cafe close to  Nothing Bundt Cakes.

We ordered the Gyro and Chicken Pita which each were $5. Both were very good and tasty. Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over.

This is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food.

I liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza.

Will definitely be back again and try other items from the menu."," Just as awesome as the other location.  I love that this is a family run business.  This location is super clean, and I love that they have so many places to sit.  The food is always top notch, fresh and comes out fast. ",Always loved this place... But had a Mediterranean gyro .. Was really bad. Soggy .. Lettuce bad and lots of oil ! The salad was not good either.. Was like it was sitting out for awhile. Not fresh. Bummer !,"Like most places, when this first opened it was excellent. Slowly though it has been going downhill and quality has been getting worse. The gyro meat doesn't seem fresh and kind of weird looking. I'd say avoid the gyros because they are pretty bad, but their other food is pretty good. Service is ok too.

Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes ( appetizer, and dessert). 

Service was excellent , even during a busy  Friday night. 

Definitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it! "," A lovely little restaurant. 
Food is slightly above average. 
Did not like their pizzas. 
They have nice wines. 
Candle light is a nice touch if you are on a dinner date. 
Not great for a group of friends though. "," I always find the food reasonable and the atmosphere, lively.  Come by yourself and enjoy your dinner at the bar with a decent selection of by the glass wines.  Food is consistently good quality and well priced though not particularly exciting.  The dining room size is perfect for keeping the space well occupied, creating enough buzz but not feeling cramped.  Staff are usually knowledgeable and well mannered.  Avoid sitting near the kitchen as poor ventilation leads to some smokiness in the air.  Ok for groups. "," This is an update to my rave review about the mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Simply, it's no longer on the menu. My next fave is Quattro Stagione. "," Pro: good service and not too noise.  

Con: substandard Italian. Veal over cooked. Pasta taste like its out of the box. Bread not worth the calories. Better Italian a few blocks away. ",Came here for lunch on a weekday.. had the eggplant parmigiani.. server did not mention it being a sandwich when asked about this dish.. it was under the main dishes so I assumed it would be a main dish.. turned out to be a sandwich with unseasoned fried eggplant some bland sauce and a piece of mozzarella on it.. not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.. my party the lamb sausage ravioli.. the sauce was watery had no consistency and it was also bland.. I do not recommend this place at all," Not sure why, but I've always viewed this establishment as the next option if Teroni's was too busy.  However, having tried it for the first time last week, Mercatto's is certainly a worthy first option if your looking for casual Italian food.  Service was excellent, decor was beautiful and a great selection of dishes on the menu, something for everyone.  

Must try the iced cuppiccino, could be the be the best in the city. ","the mercatto chain is always consistant!!! good food for a reasoable price... much prefer it over terroni... less attitude and more willingness to please... had the magheritta pizza, scallops, clams and fritto misto.... all in for less than $70!!!","Although the food is a little pricey, it's a cute little restaurant with a good ambiance.

The atmosphere at McGurkee's is reminiscent of an old town go-to with the friendliest staff in the valley. The sandwiches are inexpensive and are, in my opinion, the best Italian subs in AZ. Get the Sicilian if you want to know what a real sub tastes like.

Overall, go to McGurkee's. It'd be impossible to leave disappointed. ","Been going here since the late 80s. A family run establishment, creating some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.

From the toasted sesame rolls to the pickles and peppers, it's all about the details. My personal favorite is the Super Sicilian. Incredible!

I'd like to give them more stars, but I could get the same quality at a quiznos or subway. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a sandwich here, but if your in the area it's acceptable. "," Awesome sandwiches best bread, had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was a great experience with the homemade bread, pastrami meat and the condiments included, would not change a thing.

Did I mention the bread? It is toasted and has a great taste and firm consistency.

Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did. "," It's been a while since I've been in this place, and I figured it was time for a good sammie. I've had a few of their sandwiches in the past, but today I got the Athenian chicken sandwich. The sautÃ©ed onions and feta cheese adds a nice flavor to it. I would recommend this place if you are in the area or for someone who wants to venture out from their usual sandwich joint.","The food here is fantastic, easily the best sub sandwiches in the Arizona area. The staff are extremely friendly and will always go above and beyond in creating a delicious sandwich for you.

Our friend took us to the sister location on Nellis a couple of months ago, but this location was more convenient to our hotel.  No worries, this place was just as good!

My husband had chicken with delicious arrabiata sauce and egg plant graced by rigatoni pasta:)). We were impressed and are huge plates of food even though we both are thin people.

The food was really good. Loved the cheese and thin crust. Price was very reasonable. The owners are really friendly and I look forward to trying the rest of the items on their menu. While I was there a waiter from Grimaldi's stopped in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go. Interesting! The location is about 1/2 a mile north of Shea on 92nd Street, and currently there is road construction hindering traffic, but not too bad. I look forward to trying their homemade Tiramisu!"," Really, really, really good! It's a small place tucked in a little strip mall, but we went for an early dinner and were seated right away. We ordered a medium pizza and the spaghetti with meatballs plate and were very happy with our meal. Our new favorite Italian place! ",Have come back multiple times often ordering seafood pasta dishes which are always generous and tasty.  Their daily specials are almost always worth ordering.," You need to come here for the food alone. It is so amazing! We ordered pizza, pasta, and salad and everything was perfect.

I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.

The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter.

The broth was amazing, but my noodles weren't done right.  Some were cooked perfectly but others were chewy.  Probably will not come back "," Tonkatsu ramen is the bomb! No MSG and broth is so good! The pork is melt in your mouth and not too fatty. The egg has a little infusion of soy, ginger marinade that is extra special! Owner talks to customers and takes great pride!  I will be back! I'd take a picture but I ate it too fast!",The Ramen here is absolutely wonderful. As good as saying it might be the best I've had in a long time. They don't add MSG to their broth which is really awesome because some people are sensitive to MSG. Quality is nearly always top notch here.

55X2pom73IhiP19UFXpfPA,Stayed here for one evening. Check in was smooth and easy! Ben was awesome and very welcoming. He shows interest in each customer he is dealing with! First time visiting Arizona and he had good advice on the area. The hotel was pretty clean only problem was the outside light never tired off later in the evening so it felt like we had a night light. Very refreshing pool. Would return again!," Find yourself a better spot. No receptacle next to the bed for medical equipment.  Toilet must be really old, they're low, like for kids. The phone was broken and they never sent anyone to fix it. Only one hand towel for two people. Cabinet next to sink to hang clothes with no hangers.  One bar of soap for hand sink and shower. You get the idea. The room seemed reasonably clean. "," Best value for the money in Scottsdale. Recently renovated rooms look more like something out of Vegas for two-thirds the price of nearby competitors.
Staff is incredibly accommodating. Stephanie is a closet Victoria's Secret model and a sweetheart. She helped me look through the maid's trash to find a discarded piece of paper (my buddy's fault, not the hotel's). 
Also, someone may have gotten sick on the sheets and they didn't charge us extra. I'm stopping now. ",Staff was friendly and my 1 night stay was without a hitch. The room was clean and the pool was relaxing.,"I heard Amanda the manager sells crack out of the back office.

But seriously. Amanda was the most unpleasant, rude hotel staff person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Charged $25 for an early check-in then failed to notify us that our room was ready. Woke up our driver to inform him there's an 8 person limit per hotel room. We have 8 people and 2 hotel rooms. When we informed them of their mistake they kicked us all out and called the police. Apparently the police didn't find Amanda's crack stash in the back office (thank me for the tip later Officers!)",Great place to stay!! Rooms are big and clean. The linens on the bed were great too!! Stayed here while the Ironman competition was in town and it was still nice and quite. Will definitely stay here again!!,This place is noisy and the service is poor. There is never more than one person at the front desk resulting in massive delays. Skip this place - and look elsewhere.,Super nice for the price. Have to love getting every penny's worth. Nice lobby and service. Room really plush for $44. Big screen HDTV and king size bed. Comfortable and sleek. Great deal. Will recommend for sure.,"So this place is just average. The service is pretty bad and there are some questionable rumors going around. On the plus side, the rooms are pretty good and nice for the price you pay. They have HDTVs too now which is a plus, not some old school CRT TVs.

Both eclair and macaron taste very nice - all flavours are so natural and not overly sweet. The pistachio paste inside the eclair is nicely made. The dark chocolate and sesame flavours are well balance that they won't over power each other. 

The store is very clean and chic; I spent a very nice afternoon there.

Although it is an up-scale french bakery, the staff working there are not pretendious; they are very friendly. They recognize I am a new customer and came to check out if everything was good. Service is great! ","Really enjoyed this place! New fav spot for macaroons! I'd recommend the salted caramel, red velvet, creme brÃ»lÃ©e & hazelnut. They have other exotic flavours like blueberry lavender, lychee raspberry, etc. You can ask for a glass of water and enjoy your treats on their patio. A box of six is $13 approx. And each one is $2.25"," This place is a pastry heaven when you walk in. The eclairs, macarons, cakes are absolutely gorgeous looking. 

I've had the eclairs and macarons. Eclairs are very good!! The shoe pastry is stuffed full!! I tried their mango passionfruit and it was YUM! Macarons were perfect and a bit cheaper than nadege so I'm definitely going back. 

These pastries make excellent presentable little gifts for family and friends :) "," Stopped in just to check it out. The cakes are gorgeous and everything looked yummy. I went home with two macaroons, blueberry lavender and vodka cranberry and I will definitely be going back to try the many other flavours. They were by far the best macaroons I've ever had! ","I was quite excited about this place due to the visual presentation of their baked goods. Got 6 macarons and 6 eclairs which were packaged in a nice velvet box. They had some cool flavor combos for the macarons but flavor wise, it fell short. The eclairs were okay, didn't have a crisp bite to it. However, they are presented really well. There are better spots on queen west."," Delysees has got to be the best French bakery/patisserie in Toronto

I have been here twice - first time for macarons and the second time for croissants. They have decent coffee drinks here but the pastries definitely takes the cake (pardon the pun)

Really great tasting macarons - lots of different flavours and priced reasonably. The fresh croissants are like fluffy heavenly pillows - so buttery, flakey and soft. I would eat these daily if I lived closer. Their eclairs look absolutely stunning but I haven't gotten around to them yet.

Definitely looking to come back to Delysees to try their other offerings! "," Beautiful interior, delicious sweets, and luxurious drinks. This is a gorgeous place and the desserts are wonderful! Definitely try the cheesecake, to die for! Also the hot drinks are very nice in this cold weather! The owner/workers are super sweet too and they are passionate about what they do and will help you pick if you cant make a choice! ",Love everything!!! Its hard to choose my favourite but if I have too...it will be the gold eclair!!( Its a must try!!) its a dark chocolate with hazelnut yummmmmmyy!!,"Wow, where to start with this place? Delicious pastries and food! Yummy cakes, yummy macarons and eclairs. I can tell they care about their food and put all their effort into creating delicious foods.

Our crew was great very outgoing and talkative. We just didn't like our instructor john. We lost our camera for a second and we where looking for it when our instructor john told me to shut up and pay attention. Lucky I didn't grab him by his long hair and wooped his old ass and send him to get a perm. But other than that it was great :)," This is an outstanding adventure if you are visiting Phoenix.  Right from the outstanding customer service of Beverly in the office to the ground crew and pilots, this is a first class service.

For anyone wanting to go I make one recommendation:  do this at the beginning of your Phoenix adventure as it is very dependant on the weather.  We had our adventure rescheduled twice due to high winds and weather.  Do not wait to the last day, you may be disappointed if it is rescheduled. "," Highly recommended!!...Hot Air Expeditions company, Captain AL and Kyle made everything perfect for me and my son's (Miguel) first hot air balloon ride. We booked the sunset flight and we were fortunate enough to have the perfect weather and the perfect sunset. We ended up the perfect day with a champagne toast, big smiles in our faces and a great experience that we will forever treasure from this amazing company...

Highly recommended.,We had a fabulous experience.  The staff were amazing especially Steven our driver and Mike E our pilot!!!  5 stars for sure!," One of the best vacation adventures ever!!  The staff worked with my disability (not all companies would!!) and went overboard to be sure the experience was safe, fun and memorable! I had no idea how much work went in to launching a balloon. Thank you for the educational and fun adventure! "," WOW!  What an amazing expedition that my best friend and I will never forget.  From the moment we arrived until the champagne toast and picnic breakfast at the end we had a very memorable experience.  Captain Mike D was AWESOME!  His experience, knowledge and commentary made the ride enjoyable and our Crew Chief Al was a super human super star.  Thank you for a terrific time! "," I went on a balloon ride with Hot Air Expeditions for my birthday and it was an absolutely amazing experience. I really appreciate the staff for being so friendly and helpful. I flew to AZ from Chicago for the experience and it was well worth it. Walter was my pilot and he was great. He had a lot of knowledge of the area and explained the history of what we were flying over and seeing, as well as provided recommendations for other things to do when we landed. The crew provided breakfast and a birthday cake for us which was really sweet. I have nothing bad to say about this I recommend Hot Air Expeditions over the competitors.","Appointments can be rescheduled due to weather, but it's worth it to make the time. They offer a great opportunity for adventure, and will provide a memorable experience. The staff can be hit or miss but are generally knowledgeable and fun to work with.

2r6UD7ExSMrK0LGeglquDA,"I just officially had the best sushi in AZ if not in most of the country. I let the chef select and everything was amazing. Soy sauce would be a sin to put on this. Tuna, yellowtail and a stripped bass. I'm still waiting for my ""special roll"" and I can't wait. Don't let the outside fool you. This place is legitimate! ",We live in the neighborhood and are super happy to have this spot in the hood. We leave ourselves in the hands of the chef and he takes such good care of us. I've tried new things - Saba - Uni- and old favorites. They have a ton of rolls but we've been very happy with sashimi and nigiri. Now they have live music on Friday nights and it's just a nice friendly low key neighborhood spot. Give it a try!," Disclaimer - we went on a Monday night (birthday dinner), which violates my rules of sushi in Phoenix (don't go on Mondays)

We got a nice assortment of nigiri and maki.  The nigiri was pretty good, and they had some pretty interesting maki, too!  The presentations are very nice.

Also, for appetizers...Ninja Tears - how can you not?  (JalapeÃ±o popper type things - tasty!)

Some of the folks at the table ordered ramen, etc. too.

Very nice, and we'll have to try it again on a weekend sometime soon "," Blue Sushi is fantastic. I used to eat at Pure... not anymore. Just by dining here once, it's evident that decent portions, great service, and excellent food quality are all things that you get at Blu. I wouldn't get sushi anywhere else. ","Nothing special here. Daughter and I both had the 6 piece nigiri combo for $20. We stopped by after her volleyball game since the yelp reviews were good and we were close by. The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu(cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. 40$ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical."," We can here last Saturday night and had the best experience!! We were greeted by Jinny the owner and had the best service by her!! She truly goes above and beyond. She suggested a winterberry cocktail which was amazing considering I don't drink cocktails. It was made with Tito's vodka and fresh juice, none of that premade mixer crap. Then had the smoked salmon nigiri which was perfect, then the fire blue special roll and the blazing shrimp. Both were amazing but the blazing shrimp was my favorite, spicy but not kill you spicy. All in all we will be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a good sushi place!k "," Another awesome meal at Blue Sushi; went to celebrate my daughter's university acceptance.  I don't even look at the menu anymore.  I just talk with the staff and let them choose.  We splurged on the super fresh Bluefin Toro that was spectacular,  The special rolls for the day included a King and I roll that had a spicy Thai finish; super yummy.

This is now our GOTO sushi joint. "," Fresh fish, great prices, and the staff remember you and greet you with a warm smile upon your return. I have been here at least a dozen times and the food never disappoints. My favorites are the sushi tapas section...creative flavors combined with buttery, mouth-watering fish. Yum Yum!","This place makes probably the best sushi in all of Arizona. They give you a good value for your money, but the prices are a bit high.

They suggested mixing it with lemonade and again, I told them the fresh lime was how I wanted my drink made.   After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink.  He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.  Then the server took the drinks to us.  At which point we walked out.   Don't waste your time.  There's plenty of other places in the area.",Very tall beers and excellent waitress.  Truffle fries are excellent. Maple burger was good but the bun was not good. Too bready. Takes away from the burger deliciousness. Amazing bacon on the maple burger.  Bun just takes too much away. Get a new bun!," I absolutely love this place!  Great atmosphere in the patio, bar and dining areas.  Food is fantastic!  The Lobster roll and Maple burger are my faves! ",Not impressed with the menu at all. Burgers and hot dogs? One of our guests wanted vegetarian and the ONLY option was a veggie burger...in 2015!. Wine list is trying to impress with all the high end wines but very little in the mid range and almost nothing from regions other than US France and Italy.  With all the places to eat around here this one is a complete pass.," Nice ambiance, the drink menu is brought to you on an Ipad... COOL.  Loved the mirror that allows diners to see directly into the kitchen, foodies dream.  I had the petite filet and the truffled mac and cheese with the Rioja wine YUM.  The New York Cheesecake was sooo good!  Service was excellent as for Morbina she was awesome.  It is a bit on the pricey side. ","Our party scheduled a reservation for news years eve the day before. We originally scheduled it for 6:30 p.m. However, we had a family member playing a hockey game @3:30 on New Year's Eve. We knew we would be late so we called the restaurant and they said we have a 15 min. Grace period. So we arrived at 6:44 (1 min to spare) and they said we lost our reservation and the hostess table was extremely unprofessional and laughing and blaming it on us and was just being straight up rude. However the server was fantastic. After seeing this review we received an email with an apology and we appreciated it greatly.",Phenomenal service and tasty food. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich with parmesan truffle fries - both were delicious.," When it first opened I tried their Valentines menu and I was disappointed.  At that time the only thing I liked was the bathroom.  Decided to give it a try two years later and the food was delicious and so were the cocktails.  
Shrimp cocktail - huge shrimp 
Ravioli - Good 
Lobster Mac and Cheese - Delicious big chunks of lobster 
Tuna tartar - Delicious 
The staff was very nice and polite.  The bathroom this time was very disappointing it did not smell good and was not clean.  Overall I had a better experience the second time.  I will be back in the summer","This restaurant is a little bit overpriced, but when you get something that comes out perfect it's often worth it. The menu options are rather meat heavy and are a bit limited for people that are vegetarians though so keep that in mind.

Had the Nutella peanut butter shake as well. Less bang for your buck, but decent splurge once in a while. ",The burgers are jucy but too oily which I don't like. Below my expectations but still worth the try.," Oh my Glob. This is THE burger of Toronto. It's delicious and juicy and fresh, the fries are great, the staff are friendly and don't try to upsell you. They just recommend the House Favourite, the basic ""Holy Chuck"" burger, because it is just DE-Lish.
We went today for the boyfriends birthday, and he got the Holy Chuck. I wanted to try something new and got the misunderstood breed. While it was good and interesting, I still recommend the Holy Chuck more. The bacon patty overpowered the freshness of the beef patty so it wasn't as enjoyable. "," Our go-to burger place. You can taste the difference in the quality of the meat. It has the most interesting burger combinations and the best shakes of any burger place. And it's not pretentious with it's menu. Highly recommend.

One tip though: the St Clair location has much better and more amiable service than the Wellesley location. "," SO FRIGGIN GOOD, only problem is that they don't let you add or subtract ANYTHING. Other than that, it was so delicious. 

BUT! If you're going to get the truffle fries, I would highly recommend you staying away from them. they taste more like PEPERCORN... ""Truffle fries"" shouldn't taste like peppercorn! ",Best damn burger I have ever had !!! Can't wait to go back and try the Nutella and sea salt milk shake!  You will definitely not be disappointed.," What's great: Gluten - free bread. Soft. Tender. It sticks together when you bite.

What's not great: Makes you feel a bit sick after eating their signature burger. It's pretty fattening, but hey, if you love meat and think it's lame to be on a diet, this could be for you!

Service: Friendly and fun. "," This burger was AMAZING! I haven't tasted meat this good before. The fries aren't really worth it, but I had the holy chuck and was astounded. Super nice staff too.",This is without a doubt the best burger in Toronto. No one even comes close to having what they have.

Both were amazing, the chicken is juicy and grilled to perfection with that amazing charcoal taste.

The chicken itself is moist, charred, and flavourful, and really stands out as the star of this establishment in my opinion. Their bread is baked fresh and is just awesome.

Take a sandwich (or 2!) to go - trust me, it's worth it.",Walked into this place and was greeted with a smile.  The owner was very friendly. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and was not disappointed. The bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken.

I can't wait to get my next sandwich.,"Food was good, though I wasn't impressed with the quality of the lamb. The guy operating the cash register was a huge jerk (maybe because I'm a foreigner?) and he rounded down my change to the nearest dollar... Atmosphere was fine, nothing special.

The bad:
Lamb was super fatty.  I had to remove half of the meat because it was all gristle and uck.

Jamie was absolutely amazing he's a 5 star server!",Awesome place I love the hot wings however it would be better if there were more choices for wings I thinks I would be happier and a lot of other people would be.,"The food is more like 3* not bad for a fancy bar but nothing that makes you want to come back. But the place is noisy, even at 1:30pm with distorted music in the background. The kicker though is that for 7 of us we were told they would automatically apply 18% gratuity... So the server could not care less. We had to ask for waters, for drink refills and overall she was as unfriendly as it gets.

I was drawn to the Cronuts and wanted the cinnamon one...the lady behind the counter suggested the chocolate one, so I got both.  OMG, it was delish!.

Try this little bakery if ur at M...soo delicious! "," I LOVE PASTRIES.  That being said, the latte was pretty good.  I feel like I should have gotten one of everything but in a rush to get to the airport I ordered a chocolate croissant.  Although tasty, I prefer the chocolate to be consistent throughout the entire pastry, not just a clump in the middle.  I wish yelp let you review restaurants in European cities because the Chocolate Pistachio croissant at La Durree in Paris is the closest the to heaven I've ever tasted.  It's worth a trip to Paris just to have a treat and cafe creme at La Durree. ","Is it possible to walk by this spot in the M Resort and not immediately start salivating? No, it's really not possible. So much dessert goodness!

I always stop and stare at the glass case and contemplate what I am craving the most. And all of the desserts look so pretty and well put together.

But, in the end, 98% of the time, I just go for the gelato. And it is some really great gelato. Hint: Go for two scoops and choose two different flavors that compliment each other. Personally, the mix of coconut and chocolate chip is a fav.","This guest review is written by Claire, my inner fat girl.

Individual sized desserts are perfect for eating three to five at a time. Baguettes should be bought two at a time because the first one is unlikely to survive the 10-minute drive home. Apropos of nothing, Jay needs to start keeping European butter in the glove compartment.

I honestly wasn't expecting much. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in a sense. We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love.
I had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun.
Was good food and fun. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. ","There are limited # of restaurants in the area , this place was decent. The restaurant ambiance is small and cozy. Seats about maybe ~20 people, our group took up 1/3 of the seating area. 

Recommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.

I came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lamb, the meat was tender and well seasoned. 

Ordered the hibiscus juice made in house, it was too sour. 

Food quality: 3.5/5
Service : 4/5
Price : 3.5/5"," Very nice staff, really cute place. Food looks nice and is not bad. It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone. "," One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit.
The deconstructed tacos are a great way to share with the family. We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. It gets quite busy for dinner, make sure to make early reservations. 

One tip, try the ceviche campechano. ",We had pork carnitas (excellent) and lamb tacos (good). Solid service but felt overpriced and probably wont go back.,"Yum yum yum!!! Popped in here today for lunch. We had the whole place to ourselves because it was a Sunday and early. To begin with, the place is super cute! Absolutely love the decor.

My lunch with one beer came to $35. I feel it was worth every penny. Highly recommend!"," Good Mexican food in Toronto?  At Cocina Economica, the answer is an enthusiastic YES.  I pretty much had their entire menu, and all the dishes were quite good.  All the meats are served with rice, beans, corn tortillas and homemade (spicy) salsas.  The stand out dish for me was the Carnitas - falling off the bone.  I really enjoyed the vibe of this place. "," Top notch stuff.

Succulent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor). The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.

The decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.

Love the food but don't care much for the price to quantity of food ratio. This does not speak for the food however, it's delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful! Will recommend to my richer friends. "," Maybe not the most filling sammmmich I've ever had... but good. It always is. I went there late a night and sat by myself (sad, I know) and just played scrabble on my phone. Maybe someone from Yelp will come keep me company next time! "," I proceeded to watch the four people who ordered behind me get their food before me. All I had was a potato. One guy behind me got the same thing I did (just a larger version) and got his before I did. And when I finally got my potato, it barely had any toppings on it. Really dry. Not tasty. Saving grace is the free ice cream you get. ",Great place to eat. Food always taste fresh. Frequently visit ray road location. Ice machine always seems to be broke. Kind of unsanitary to scoop ice with scooper laying in the ice.,I stopped by here for a quick bite to eat.  I got the club sandwich minus the tomatoes and a cup of chili.  The food was really good.  I like the little graham crackers they have at the salad bar too.  I like this place and recommend it.  They have a good selection so you should be able to find something.," Wife and me shared the salad and soup. 
Of course the soup was broccoli and cheese. 
And they have a lot of toppings for the salad bar.
Good bluecheese.
Very clean.
Easy parking. ","Love this place! People are friendly and a ton of low carb options!! Clean, good, quick! One of my fav lunch places! Sometimes they go too fast and serve up less than perfect food. My avocado was mostly brown and the bacon was 80% fat.","They have yummy baked potatoes. They have different sizes. I ordered the big one. Took a little while and I noticed there was no rhyme or reason to who was getting their food at what times. Seems the kitchen might be a bit unorganized. Other than that, the food was really good.

The stylist I had is good at what she does but needs to improve on actually listening to what the customer wants. She was however, the gentlest stylist I've ever had which was amazing.

The Brussel sprouts sounded  good but were  bland.

AprÃ¨s Ã§a j'ai Ã©vitÃ©e ce choix de viande. MalgrÃ© cela, il y a un bon rapport qualitÃ© et prix. Les employÃ©s sont courtois. Je raffole des desserts. Les entrÃ©s sont correct. "," Solid ramen. Nice portion size. A busy, cozy restaurant. The ramen was delicious, as were the cocktails. Also, the rice balls, which my companion ordered, and I'd never had - UMAMI HEAVEN. Really tasty.

Inexpensive, tasty and lively - in Montreal's somewhat small Chinatown. Worth a visit if you are craving Ramen, and I was.! "," Awesome ramen soups! Cheap, nothing too fancy but really tasty! 

The raviolis are ok but nothing to die for. 

Udon noodles and pepper broth are really good. Its a really nice spot for lunch or quick dinner. 

Cheap and spicy!!

Love. "," This was definitely a 'Meh' experience. The fast food of ramen- not terrible, but definitely not good.
The menu does offer a lot to pick from if you're looking to snack, but I wouldn't bother with the ramen at all. ","Broth is decent (for Montreal). Noodles are OK (for Montreal). However, there is no edible ramen place within 2 km so this will do."," I took the spicy ramen mmmm feel so good in a freeze day. Crowdy place, good service. "," One of the better ramen joints in Montreal, and certainly the best in Chinatown!  Fun ambiance, a good menu (much more than ramen if you feel like a change!), and lots of seating. "," I'll admit it. I came here because Naruto likes ramen and I've rarely had it outside those really cheap bags of noodles you boil when you're in college. Or at work for lunch. I was a solo lunch diner, as I had dipped out of a conference for some better food than the conference center was offering. This place delivered. It was clean and the service was FAST. The ramen was delicious, and the recommendation of the server was spot on. Decor was modern and had several nods to anime. If I lived in the area I would probably be back here. Naruto was right, ramen is yummy!","Ramen noodles are good here and good portion sizing, but it's crowded and that may or may not be a bad thing depending on what you want. Everything is fast and came out fast, and there's a lot to choose from when looking at the menu.

373HGZUJm47MupH8QBx8Zg,This is a tattoo spot located on the way south end of the Strip in what feels like a nearly abandoned strip mall. I walked in without an appointment was able to have an artist work on my tattoo right away. Note: Appointments are best. The front desk staff were less than friendly. But the artists are great! The studio is clean and comfy. Definitely one of the better places I've been to. I'm very pleased with my tattoo and will be coming back for more work.,A friend referred me to West Coast after going I will not get my tattoos anywhere else! Jake is awesome and it's the cleanest shop I've seen. I would only recommend West Coast Parlor," I've been worked on by just about every artist there, but Jake is my go-to. The work this place is putting out reminds me what I love about tattoos - custom artwork. Not to mention, the atmosphere and energy of this place is overwhelmingly...comfortable. This is a great shop all around, the artists are extremely talented, smart, funny, super sweet, and they're not bad to look at either! ","I got everything I wanted and more with my tattoo. The shop was clean and organized. It is conveniently located right off the I-15 and Silverado ranch.  Russ took his time and made sure every detail was exactly the way I wanted it. He was very kind and personable. If you're looking to get a tattoo done by a nice guy and great artist, go see Russ! He doesn't disappoint! Thanks again!"," It is rare to find a tattoo shop and good artist as quickly as I did. Collin at West Coast was awesome! Friendly, great tattoo artist and made my visit quick and easy. Found the shop on yelp so thought I would leave a review in case someone else wants a Great Experience. They are the perfect place to checkout while in Las Vegas. ",Amazing! Such an awesome atmosphere and friendly people. Definitely recommend this establishment for tattoos!! West coast f@ckin rocks!," My husband and I went in for a lock and key tattoo. We were incredibly thrilled with the work our artist, Colin, did.  He was great and drew our vision of them to create something just perfect for us. We will definitely attempt to have Colin do the next tattoo when we come back to Vegas. "," I was originally a walk-in with a kinda unusual request to have a micro tattoo on my finger... I was lucky to find Colin!  Colin got exactly what I was looking for. Colin was amazing  in giving advice about placement, color, etc.... Colin is an amazing artist. I look forward to going to see Colin to get more great tattoos.","This is an amazing tattoo place!  The shop is extremely clean and the tattoo artists are very talented.  I don't want to get my tattoos done anywhere else!

","I've lived nearby for more years than this location has existed, and have visited this location maybe 20 times. Unfortunately, 99% of Avondale restaurants fall victim to seamy clientele. They manage to entirely ruin most businesses around here. 

About 6 months ago, you were doing well to find your salad was made with all fresh ingredients. Then they started tasting  slightly more spoiled. Now my husband and I find they can't even get themselves together to sell us a pastry or smoothie."," They are lucky that they even get one star because I don't think they deserve that. The girl taking my order had no idea what she was doing so I'm assuming she was new, which leads me to believe the person that should be training her obviously had better things to do. I picked up my order and got back to work. The apple that came with the food was disgusting. How can you say fresh food and be known for having healthy meals when you are serving rotten food??? You would think that they could at least look at the food they are sticking into the bags, must be too much work to do that... ","Normally this place is awesome, occasionally packed but worth the wait.  Today not so great! Not just out of one thing today but 4! they didn't have chicken noodle soup,macaroni and cheese, onion soup or green tea. Then they said onion soup isn't a Sunday soup, even though it's on the menu online for Sunday. After I paid I realized they were out of tea, and the kid said oh yes we're  waiting for a shipment. Be out one thing ok fine but 4 things is ridiculous. Some one did horrible job when ordering this week!  I should have asked for a refund and went to Zuppas! Definitely disappointed in today's  trip to Panera!","Came in on a Tuesday around 1030am they were out of most of there bagels.  Their toaster was down so they heated it on a press poor choice came out hot like it was microwaved.  Coffee had a brew time of 9:15 however it was really bitter tasting by the time I got to it.  I requested a refund,  and they lost me as a customer.  I won't be returning to many other places for bagels in a big city like Phoenix."," We love Panera, food always seems fresh and is very tasty. The staff has ALWAYS been so very nice and courteous each time as well, we will be back many times! The broth bowls are very good, only tip  would be to ask for salad dressings on the side bc they do tend to put a little too much dressing on for my tastes. ","Every time I come to Panera, there's never any disappointment. Today, however, was exceptionally delicious. I ate literally everything on my plate. The Mediterranean sandwich and Greek salad is so on par with gourmet restaurants. 10/10.","way too over priced! small mac n cheese is $5. HALF a salad is $6 a SMALL drink is $2.50 RIDICULOUS! i don't recall Paradise being this expensive. overall a lunch for 2 was $30. although the salad was good, i could've bought a bigger size somewhere else for the same price!","Recently renovated , but the food is hit or miss. The food is often not very fresh and sometimes even rotten. Even the coffee doesn't seem fresh.

The splashpad is a great addition for the kiddos. "," Love shopping here and spending time with my family a little bit for everyone,great place !!! ","Not bad.  The entire mall is very clean.  It is about 75% occupied which is good in this economy.

They have a very large play area for kids if that is your thing.  And a food court with lots of vending machines through out.

I'm always hesitant when ordering from a new Asian restaurant from so many bad experiences here.

The lady on the phone was typical of any other Asian restaurant and very friendly.

Ordered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness. 

Prices were better than most places as well.  Would order again. ",Good food great for take out to take to work. Always ready when I come to pick up. Really like their shrimp fried rice and soups.," The food was delicious, price was pretty good, but the lack of atmosphere and food being served on Styrofoam plates was a bit of a turn off.

I was heard this place was good but I was so so disappointed and upset after trying it. I went with a group of 8 friends here, although my food was average, two of my friends got some type of chicken stir fry dish. The chicken in the dish was spoiled and had a rotting smell! And I know for a fact the smell was not from any sauce or spice, it was just plain spoiled chicken! The waitress was informed and removed it from the bill but I think I should of called the county health inspector. And we took my 2 friends to a urgent care for a per-caution for food poisoning and both later did vomit the food up. Obviously I will never return here and WARN others.","In search for a different non chain place to eat for lunch today, I found this new gem! It is well located just south of the 1-10.

I ordered the vegetable and tofu jasmine rice dish. The sauce was very well seasoned and the tofu had great flavor. There were a few too many onions but overall the flavor was great! The shrimp spring rolls are good but the peanut could use some more flavor. 
The prices are very reasonable. Most dishes are ~$6.99. 
Overall great experience so my husband and I will be back to try out ore dishes on the menu.","Really enjoy this pho spot. Only reason why I'm leaving 3 stars is due to the fact that I placed a to go order, and when I arrived 20 min later (which they said it'd be ready in 20) they said they never received the order.

The first you noticed, of course, was the huge display cupcake sitting on the counter.  The walls were adorned with cute pink wallpaper and a few sets of cute t-shirts were set up.   All of the cakes looked good, but I decided to try the chocolate peanut butter cupcake.  The crunchy peanut butter frosting tasted delicious and the cake was good, but was not the best I have ever eaten.  And $3.75 was really expensive for one cupcake.  Oh well, it was my one cupcake in Vegas.","More like the Cupcrapery.....

1. Pretty and sparkly on the outside, nasty in the inside.  

2.  I didn't read YELP first.  Fail.

3.  Basically the same as what everyone else said.  Dry cupcakes.  Frosting is gritty sugar.  Not even the fluffy or creamy kind.  Just gritty.

4.  I had the oh my gosh ganache, kir royale, coco frauline, and strawberry shortcake.   Out of the four the ganache was the most tolerable.  So I gave it four chances at least.  4 bucks on each cupcake.  Fail again."," Went to vegas for a bday celebration and instead of getting a cake we decided to get a dozen cupcakes for the birthday boy!!!

I don't specifically remember all the cupcakes but I do remember the Kir Royale cupcake because it was simply beautiful. Edible (?) glitter topped the delicate frosting and I want another one now!!! Sure it's pricey but it's vegas. Anyways, would come back for a sweet treat. "," For the price, you would expect more.  

The deserts at the buffets were better! "," I don't know what everyone else is talking about. This place had a pretty good cupcake. I had a Kir Royale, raspberry cupcake, champagne infused, and with silver glitter to top. Maybe if I were super picky, I would say it was a tiny bit dry, but I'm not going to be so critical. The raspberry taste and the frosting made the cupcake fantastic. Yum. 

I'm hopefully going to try the cinnamon roll one and the orange-pineapple one. "," I'd give it a four if the goal was to have a Little Debbie, but even then this place falls short. Not a good choice. If you're looking for a sweet treat, there is a Pink Berry in front of The Cosmopolitan.","The cupcakes are pretty good. Not amazing, but good. Some people don't seem to like it but I feel that it just really depends on the person and what they are in the mood for. They have some unique flavors of cupcakes and quite a variety.  Price was a little on the high side, but this isn't a cheap place and that's probably why.",6WSIOY8-hLFyjfF25LwyYg,MIYjtdul6rt4EnA2UTM0FA,nbypyAM3FN5kp_4RiQbIfA,swQEbxvNBij82J8NwBRWsA,cBiCeOi1a4siBd-5NI6KRA,uuN4SIUWUQm16KM2lwD_iA,ILdf17IYPV9j8ujJEt365Q,e4LiXZ155q3eMuZZrN9Y6Q

Service was good but server was new and seemed a little nervous and it was understandable since we were a party of 10. Food was great. I had stuffed Manicotti and would get it again!!," Came in for Mother's Day with a large party. They let us make a reservation the day before. Service was great, the food was even better. Everyone left fat and happy. Love this place! ",Absolutely hands-down one of the best Italian restaurant in Surprise Az Service is absolutely phenomenal even down to the manager Noel who was very attentive to us. We will definitely be visiting again,"The Steak 'N Blue and Chopped Gorgonzola salads are yummy!! My husband and I have been coming here for years and have never had a terrible experience. Cameron is our favorite waiter but they are all great! By the way, the bread is always fresh and 100 times more flavorful than Olive Garden's bread sticks."," Nice atmosphere with friendly staff. 
Clean and open floor plan. 
The roasted Brussel and Beet salad was fantastic, the Anna's lasagna was a bit salty but had a nice sauce. 
House cabernet was tasty, overall a nice experience. ",This place is my favorite!! I would eat here everyday if I could! Lol love love love it!!!," It's ok. Floor was dirty and our waiter seemed almost clueless. Food was good but not ""write home about"" "," I had the pasta rustico which tasted like straight up tomato sauce out of a can, could have used any kind of seasoning, very bland. The fresh bread is excellent. My boyfriend had the mac n cheese which he loved but I was not very happy with my pasta.",If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant in the Surprise AZ area this is the place to visit.

My order is accurate every single time, no matter what I order (I highly recommend getting the Thai Iced Tea with boba). The tea itself is delicious, and service is incredibly fast. Never heard a single complaint about them. I love it so much, I go weekly. That much. ",10/10 one of the best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh. Drinks are made fresh and delicious. Cups are a little smaller than the everyday noodles (in squirrel hill) bubble tea cups but Fuku tea is cheaper. Loved the new green Thai tea drink! Recommend this drink with grass jelly ^_^ also the regular Thai tea is my fav at Fuku tea and a must have for people who love sweet drinks!," Fuku is on my top two best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh! I would say Fuku is great for fruity/tea drinks, whereas at Everyday Noodles I'd prefer to get milk teas there. My go-to is usually the traditional green tea, no sweetness, tapioca topping with honey and peach/mango flavors. Or I would get the golden lemonade. 

Fuku is a really popular place to hang out with friends, do casual meet-ups, or even study. I think I usually run into someone I know every time I go there haha. Best bubble tea fix when coming back to school :) "," This little shop just had their soft opening, and so far, I'm really liking what Fuku Tea has to offer to Oakland. The bubble tea here is delicious and more customizable than the other bubble tea stores on campus (and cheaper than Chick 'N Bubbly), and the store sells cute pastries, including macaroons. Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea. "," It was cool that you could choose ingredients and toppings. The people there also so nice and happy to start their first days

I went back there today and they still seems very excited about their business. They are happy to interact and provide good service. 

The tea there is also nice. I like both their green tea and black tea though so far I prefered green tea as it has a lighter taste in my opinion. I'm never tried the bubbled teas with milk but I recommened both the mango and the Almond flavor. Don't forget the tropica as they are what makes bubble tea fun right? ","Nice little shop in the heart of Oakland; the boba was actually a little disappointing because it didn't mix as well as it should have, but the little dessert I bought (a chocolate mousse) made up for it enough for me to swing them up to a 4 star rating. Seems like a nice place to study."," I love how clean and straight forward this place is! They have a lot of the authentic loose tea options along with their signature milk teas and smoothies.

The service was friendly and fast. I also LOVE that they have a soy milk option. It changes EVERYTHING for me since I'm lactose-intolerant. I ordered the small Thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted DELICIOUS. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy. Prices were fair. 

I will come back here for future boba tea purchases! "," Great bubble tea. I got a coconut black tea with bubbles and was very happy with it. Glad to see they rinse their tapioca until they are fully hydrated and then hold them in a warm crock prior to serving, so they are not under-cooked at all upon serving.

Also, they don't skimp out on bubbles, I got about half a cup in a small tea. I'll be back again.","Great place for bubble tea , lots of options to customize your drinks and toppings! They also offer loose teas and milk teas. The desserts are nice as well, they offer mousse, macaroons, and pastries ect. The price point is fair, cheaper than some other local options.

I found a quote to replace my windshield from their website and when I called the manager, Chris, said they would do it for less and have me out the door in less than an hour. I waited less than 20 minutes and my windshield was finished. These guys are awesome! Best deal in town with the best customer service!","I moved to Las Vegas 3 years+ ago, and my convertible top was damaged from old age.  I asked the guys at Superior for a recommendation on a place to get the top repaired since they are family owned and operated.  When I went to their recommended place (West Charelston Auto Upholstery) the Todd Craik at WCAU did the repair free of charge.

About 1 month ago I wanted to sell my old 2004 Honda Civic, which had a cracked windshield.  I asked Superior for their best cash price (i.e. Green $ no credit card) and the finished the installation in 35 minutes with an appointment all for $140!  They are competitive and fast!","Amazing customer service from the Manager, Chris.  I got one of my cars tinted about 2 years ago and it's still great to this day (so great that I got my other car tinted as well!) 


Good prices and quick turn around


I definitely recommend these guys!"," Needing a windshield replacement, I called several different places before coming across Superior. I spoke to Chris who quoted me a price that was nearly half of every other company I called. Needless to say I was hesitant because it sounded too good to be true but I decided to use Superior anyway. Thank goodness I did! Chris was accommodating to my last minute schedule changes, open to any questions and concerns I had, and (most importantly) he stayed true to his price quote and didn't try to get more money out of me.  My windshield looks awesome and I am completely satisfied with the quality of work that Chris provided.  I will definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know! ",Just had my car windows tinted today.  Bob was very helpful and my car was done in about an hour...he also gave me a good price.  Great job and very efficient.  I am recommending Superior to friends and family.,"Chris is beyond professional. Quality work, awesome business. Came to get my windows tinted and they got me right in. Took about 2 hours and the price was very fair. You get what you pay for! :)","I wish I could rate them more than 5 stars. Chris was amazing, from speaking to him on the phone to meeting him in person. He was so enthusiastic and willing to help us out. We're from California and happened to get a chip on the windshield during the drive out to Vegas, but I would drive out here for the great prices and fantastic service. I highly recommend Superior Auto Glass."," I got my front windshield replaced after a rock cracked it ... he gave me a great price , and through phone call and in person was excellent customer service! He said it was an hr wait and i think they even did it faster than that ! I would highly recommend them to anybody i know .. one of the best services ive had in awhile in this town...","I had to have my windshield replaced so I came here. They have online quotes, but it can be less or more, so definitely talk to someone real for a realistic quote. Both Bob and Chris are really helpful and seem to really want to help. You can tell they want their customers to keep coming back and build a loyal customer base. When I called Chris on the phone he went above and beyond to help me.

3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"The food and service were very good.  As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another.  Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back. "," We had our wedding reception dinner here. We had a family style prix fixe with an emphasis on seafood. Truly fantastic. Oysters, crab legs, etc. The family style was great, as everyone could try the perfectly cooked steak, scallops, or salmon (the chicken was fine, but everything else was significantly better). 

Service was also top notch. There were several people continually helping with each course and making adjustments (wait for the next course, bring the next one faster, etc.). At the end, there was a small mixup with the pricing but that was quickly resolved. "," First of all, I am a seafood fan. And both times I went here I was a guest of someone else so I wasn't paying the bill.

That being said, the lobster corn dogs are amazing! Also the chilean sea bass. Get the salad that you can customize and you will not be disappointed. ","First time dining here.  Heard much about Michael Mina.  Place was pretty empty at 6pm on a Friday night.  

Food was a absolute 10, but the wait service was a 2.  I must say the buser was fantastic.  Our server was too chatty about nothing and was not helpful in making choices. Drinks went dry often this night, we would getr so partched.

Fod was fabulous. Appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and inovative.  The angry lobster and grilled scallops were perfect.  Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel.  The scallops were so tender just warmed through.","Amazing!  If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring/summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out.  They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.  One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years."," For an overpriced Vegas restaurant, this one isn't bad.  Great seafood platter, good scallops, excellent scalloped potatoes, and they threw in some more potatoes since we ordered so much stuff. ","Dinner # 2 of last week's vegas trip.  

 I wasn't so hot on the space, as I felt like I could have been eating in a chain restaurant.

There was also zero talent in the place.  For Vegas, even during a guy-dominated convention, that is simply inexcusable (and don't forget that the AVNers were showing up around then).","My friends and I stayed at MGM last week. After hitting a straight flush in three card poker I thought I'd take the guys out to a solid dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3-4 of us to sample a couple legs.  I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium.  Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta.  Definitely worth checking out if you win some money at the casino, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere considering the steep price for the good, but not excellent food.","This place will leave you with very satisfied.  Definitely one of the best seafood joints in Vegas.  They have a very large menu to choose from and it includes things like oysters, lobster, crabs, pretty much anything you could want as far as seafood.  They even mix in steak and chicken to some of the meals.  I was very impressed.",sMopnwACqeJpvqBPDozCvA,SyuVQzgy4l3md2FLloEs5A,Mj9dbE18S1myNQph2FJlWg,ZTyyfIPq5qffLNV-3IIzig,NaKuaEd1E9_FdiJo0ry3Qg,xnaXBYIIhPdILvGgSP_TJw,wditcGsWhlm36xXL4vDD_Q,vEWGZh9HZYc64iY-IHNkEA

You can tell the food is authentic and the owner is very friendly. This is our third visit in two weeks and we will definitely be back.," Exceptional. Well priced, phenomenal service, fresh and high quality ingredients, and delicious food. I had beef kabob, rice, and vegetables, accompanied with the fresh, made daily in house bread. The meal was served with a great salad, which may be the nicest house salad I've ever seen. I found myself returning the next day and tried the chicken kabob, which was again perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the price you get a very good amount of food. They don't over do it at all, you will feel satisfied after your mean but not overly stuffed. I have no hesitation returning to this restaurant and recommending it to others. ","MoMo's is an absolute gem of a restaurant!  The food is incredibly tasty--perfectly spiced and cooked.  All ingredients are fresh and high-quality.  If you are looking for truly outstanding, authentic, healthy food--this is your place.  Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming.  Price cannot be beat--we fed our family of 4 here including fresh salads, delicious moroccan tea for all, generous meals, fresh-baked bread, and the amazing French cookie sampler, all for under $45.  We truly enjoyed this place and recommend highly to others!"," The food was fantastic (lamb medallions) and the service was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh. The owner is very personable, friendly, and attentive. Make sure you tell them if you want the tea or not because it will be added to your bill. We never asked for it but it was presented so we thought it was included. Enjoy! ","We haven't had good moroccan food in cleveland in quite some time. Place is a small sit down spot right down the block from cedar lee cinema. My wife and sis each had a kabob, one chicken and one beef they were both season well and pretty good, but not the best I ever had. But what I really enjoyed was the couscous which is a north african staple. The restaurant has couscous on fridays and tajines on saturday as specials. I got the lamb couscous (pictured) but beef and vegan couscous were also offered as options. Plus a pot of moroccan mint tea for $5, I will def be coming back to explore more menu options"," Absolutely recommend this one and only Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland! Three of us shared tabouli, beef kabob, chicken kabob, Harira soup, French cookies and hot sweet mint tea. They cook with a wood fired oven that brings a delicious smokey flavor to the food. Even the veggies were cooked in the oven. The bread was divine! The decor was of course very Moroccan with fluffy sofas and several colorful poufs to sit on. Muhammed is a very friendly host. Definitely check this place out! "," An authentic Moroccan experience! Start with the mint tea and order the special of the day. If it is beef tajine (like today's lunch), then you're in for a real treat! The owner, Mo will start you off with a crisp salad and warm bread. A few minutes after you're done, he will bring out a traditional tajine earthen pot. Lift the lift and enjoy! ","(4.5) Dope place with awesome tea and delicious cookies. The menu may be simple but the food is all great. Even the bread is delicious! Everything tastes extremely fresh. It's like the chef just bought everything the same day. 

The service is great and courteous. If you get the mint tea the server will give it to you the Moroccan way!","If you are in the market for some great fresh food this is a wonderful restaurant to check out. The food is authentically Moroccan and they always have great specials that change every day. All of their kabobs feature excellent cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, and are cooked and seasoned to perfection.

I was able to put together a low carbohydrate soy coconut smoothie that was both delicious and healthy. I'm very happy to come here again knowing that this place caters to everyone. "," This place is pretty small, but they have a lot of donut choices. They also sell boba (Asian drink). The place is cozy. My kids loves it. I'm not a big donut fan but they got good flavors. Definitely coming here next time.
Good customer service. ","There is a reason this place has such good reviews (in my opinion it deserves 5 stars). Every time I have gone, the owner always gives me a couple of donut holes, free of charge. I don't eat donuts often, but when I'm in the mood for one I'm fortunate enough to live just down the street from this place. Everyone in the Mesa area should come here at least once. Their coconut cream filled donuts are to die for. Their smoothies are amazing too. If I could write a million 5-star reviews for them, I absolutely would.","Would give this place more stars, but I haven't tried my raspberry fritter yet. This review is for their drinks. Unfortunately, they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks. I was excited when she had said that they use ""real fruit"" in their fruit yogurt drinks. To my disappointment, even asking if she could add some extra blueberries, she poured in about 5-6 blueberries over about 2 ounces of a liquefied yogurt, added powdered flavoring a and ice and water, and there appeared my wonderful blueberry yogurt shake. No thanks.... Maybe I would come again for donuts.","Best donuts I have found in Mesa or AZ in the 28 years I've lived here! Excellent selection, Friendly people and YUMMY!"," This has become our new weekend tradition to grab some donuts and a boba tea. We found this place a couple months ago and have loved it everytime.

"," THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! Look, I'm not saying this place is necessarily a place I'd ""hang out"" at but everything they serve is simply awesome! You'll never want doughnuts from anywhere else again. Bubble Tea is here to if that's your deal! ","Apparently we went here on an off day. We decided to stop in and try this new neighborhood donut shop. We ordered a berry smoothie, French Vanilla Iced Coffee and two old fashioned donuts. The smoothie was tasteless, the iced coffee was too sweet and the donuts were crunchy and tasted like grease dipped in sugar glaze. The boy (11 or 12 years old) that waited on us was very efficient and nice. Won't be back. We threw everything out, wasn't edible.","This place may be a doughnut shop but they serve much more than that. You can order a smoothie or tea, and with a bit of thinking you can even make it healthy. The doughnuts are of course awesome as they should be for a restaurant dedicated to them. Some of the smoothies are made with powdered flavorings if you dislike that kind of thing but they are great. They seem to have off days every once and awhile because the last time I was there the doughnuts tasted pretty bad but that was just one visit and everyone gets a second chance.",l4yk1q0Fx7gXlnaUq4jneg,gHm5bRJkfaFXruEPSH5q9g,TXdALtei-YkEWd6n6i89_g,1GXbAU_Yuns-FB0XejpNmQ,qygfSHkTNzKaZp03yZeE1g,kP7nZCLT89cdrEkDDXiYLg,Wvcmv3BoA07n3kqp_lhqWg,#NAME?

I have been going to Birdsong since they first opened. I have always enjoyed their Free Will. They have made a couple new brews as of late that I sampled and all are really good. I love that they are right across the way from Noda Brewery and tend to always go to both of them during my visits. I love the games and the free peanuts. For the quality of the beer, I feel the prices are really good. Hoping to see some additional brews in the future. "," Birdsong is a gem. A true gem! I was over at NoDa and wandered back and around to Birdsong. The staff were vvery friendly and I found the bar a bit like home. They have a great outdoor area and, most importantly, their beer is quality.

I'm generally not a fan of flavored beers.

but! their Jalapeno Pale Ale!? Hello deliciousness. Seriously. Give it a try. "," Great beer to try! Fun flavors like Jalapeno Pale Ale. the staff inside is nice and friendly.

The smell and taste wrk great for it, you have got to try! "," Had the extra pale ale and loved it.

 In fact I loved everything about this place. The vibe was ideal for a long night of serious causal drinking. From the peanuts on the table to the friendly bartenders, this place just felt homey as soon as you sat on a stool. But unlike other dive this bar has delicious beer and an a chill atmosphere that really makes the beer go down quick and easy. 

I am looking forward to visiting again! ",We thought that we would give this place a shot considering the positive reviews.  However our visit was all but positive.  First of all I don't believe that the air conditioning was working.  I know that in the past some places do this to encourage the beer consumption.  I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if thats the case at least make sure that the beer is cold.  I spoke to someone up at bar and she basically said that because the beer is brewed there its not served cold but just slightly colder than room temperature.  If I wanted a warm pint of bitter I'll go to the U.K.  Needless to say we won't be back.,"If you're looking for a comfortable and inviting bar this is a great place to go. They have a lot of unique beers on tap that you will not find anywhere else.

"," Wow! Amazing food and impeccable service. Our waiter Danny was awesome, so accommodating and nice.. and Jackson was great too- infectious smile. "," I have been to plenty and I mean plenty of Chinese and Hong Kong cuisine restaurants. Blossom has stood out, they do their own mix on traditional dishes. I recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, & the Fried Flounder. The walnut prawns are by far the best I've ever had, they are not completely soaked in the mayonnaise. There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination. The flounder is fried to a crisp and juicy. Overall, you're paying for what you get and this is a must stop in Vegas. "," Amazing service!! Amazing food!!! Omg.... this place is so impressive!! The atmosphere is beautiful and Victor was so sweet and personable!! And Sam was the best server and so accommodating!! He made our dinner experience perfect. Let us taste wine, jokes around with us, recommended dishes and we were so impressed!!! Thank you Blossom!! We had a girls trip and we had reservations at STK, but last minute we canceled and came to blossom.... what a great choice!!! ","5 stars for decor and ambience c/o Aria
100 stars for customer service

The menu however didn't quite cut it for me. I'm vegetarian and there wasn't a whole lot on there that peaked my little taste buds. There's the usual spring rolls, fried rice, and soup you can go with but for such a high end restaurant I was expecting a little more. 

The one thing you absolutely HAVE to try though is their Jasmine tea. It's the most delicious tea i've ever tasted and honestly that almost made up for the menu being not so awesome.",auto loses a star because asian food should not be this expensive... food was great and the service was good but i just feel like i can get better asian food for a better price elsewhere... next,"We ordered Peking duck, spicy lobster fried rice and Chinese broccoli. I think only in Vegas you can spend 150.00 on three dishes for Chinese food. Okay enough about the price, overall I enjoyed my experience here at blossom. The staff were really attentive and I like all the high end decor. Definitely not your typical Chinese take out. Would I be coming back the next time I stay at Aria??, the answer would definitely be yes!!!"," Foods were good, but the wait is too long in between for every meal to come out, the restaurant wasnt busy at all, needa work on time management guys!!!!!","Ok, so first of all, the food at Blossom is amazing.  Its some of the most quality Chinese food you'll ever eat.  The fried flounder is crispy and full of flavor!  The atmosphere is pretty good too.  The only bad thing is the fact that it will cost you an arm and a leg to eat  here.

I went to this place maybe five times and my last visit the portions were way smaller. The food here is good but apparently they cut their portions. I ordered three wraps and all three of us were left hungry.

Thanks for responding, I went to your restaurant on Monday April 20th. I ordered 2 Balboas and a Santa Fe chicken wrap. I placed the order over the phone and the cashier seemed new or just confused. The main issue I had was the wraps, now in a smaller container weren't nearly as big. All three of us felt the same and were left somewhat disappointed."," I have recently been guided by my loving wife to a healthier eating lifestyle. It's been difficult because most of the time it tastes like dirt. Today I have been converted. I had this amazing meal that has me so converted that I decided to try out a weeks worth of meal preps. Being on the run my normal lunches consist of fast food and snacks. I think this may be a great solution to my issue of eating something actually good for me rather than something to just fill my gut. 

If you want something awesome, try out the ahi and avocado salad. It was AMAZING! "," I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Friendly staff, good food and lots of choices. I'll definitely be back. "," In spite of the avg of three stars, this place is worthwhile. Food is tasty, carb-conscious, and made right in front of you. Service is good. DÃ©cor best described as ""bro"", which is a cool novelty. Across from Sportman's, which is also cool.

One star off for portion size. "," Great atmosphere, food is tasty and staff is friendly. The restaurant was recently remodeled and the new owners are awesome! It's nice to go out to eat and not feel guilty about your calorie intake. I had the godfather and it was delicious. Give this place a try! "," Been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went. Fist impression was i noticed the cooking line/area was cluttered a didnt look clean. The cooks were wearing gloves but unfortunately wiping sweat from their foreheads and continuing to cook and handle food.

I ordered the mmg signature wrap which didnt taste bad but had a horrible smell to it, not sure if it was cheese or sauce or smells mixing with the side broccolli. The worst part about the experience is i have spent the last hour with repeated visits to the toilet after eating (sorry to be graphic).   The peach pear smoothie was pretty tasty. I unfortunately will not be back. ","I appreciate seeing new healthy options in my city. 
It's just sad to see that they aren't all great as they seem to be. A healthier approach should be tasty! 
I ordered the Mexicana which tasted like canned salsa on top; Sweet Potato fries which tasted like they were microwaved after being frozen ($3.99); and a side of guac $1.99 for 2 oz

It got me by from hunger but I would not be coming back.","This place has some fantastic healthy food if you're looking to try something new.

749MsdV9v1SijXaLrY23pw,What a nice place. wish there was a bit of better explanation of what to do but it tasted wonderful. A bit pricey but I could tell that when I walked in. I really enjoyed the food though," The wine bar has a nice selection of wines, albeit a little on the expensive side. The service was decent although flagging down someone for another glass at times can be a bother. This seemed to be an issue for tables that were further from the bar. It was also nice to have the store right next door now as opposed to being across the street. "," WInes by the glass change all the time.  A place where knowing about wine is helpful, but the choices are so well selected you won't make a mistake if you don't know anything.  The small plates are Really good.  Patio is great for people watching.  The wine flights are perfect for trying out new things! Love going here with girlfriends after a good movie right down the street(walking distance) at Phillips place theater. "," I really love that this place is here & you can find speciality items that normal grocers don't carry. I was able to find some products I've had my eye on for a long time(the coconut cult probiotic yogurt)& ghee butter by fourth & heart. 

I love that this place is close by but omg it's expensive. I was so excited to find the goods but was also shock on how expensive they were. But overall I do plan to go back & try their deli. The fresh food looked & smelled soooo good!! It's a must I go back "," I thought I'd write a short update to D&D Wine Room....

Thursday night Hubster and I went here for a glass-o-vino and to celebrate three things.  Me, My birthday, and the weekend.  LOL! I love everyone here.  So friendly, so nice, and....is that someone playing an acoustic guitar??  Such a wonderful touch!!  Sitting on the patio underneath the trees lined with white Christmas lights and listening to the amazing singer sing ""Marry Me"" almost brought me to tears.  It's the simple things in life....

I heart you D&D wine room....thank you for a great Thursday night! "," Who would have thought that December would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at Dean and DeLuca?  That is what I did today and it was divine.   I love coming here to build my own salad.  I had the pear vinaigrette dressing and I could have sucked that up through a straw.  Even though it is a little pricey, the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best.  It's also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items.  The atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping.  Definitely a winner in Charlotte. "," I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But, like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for the hot sandwiches no matter how many times I get burned by the customer service. "," The Dean & Deluca wine room never fails to deliver some of the very best food in Charlotte. No pretense, just really great quality food with a creative flair, and good spirited and attentive service. And they recently added valet parking making a visit to Phillips Place on a Fri or Saturday night seamless.",Dean & Deluca wine room is one of my favorite places to go before or right after a movie. The selection is amazing. The prices can be a bit high on some items but they make up for it with atmosphere and ambiance. The outdoor patio is perfect to sit back and relax with a glass of wine and people watch. There selection rotates often but you can always find something good.

The drinks are over priced and the service is just okay. My card was misplaced for 5 minutes. The bartender told me she handed it back to me. I would know if my card was given back to me especially if it was on top of the receipt. I was made to feel really uncomfortable because I was told that I had misplaced my own card. The card was finally located in the bartenders cup which holds all of the receipts and cards. So it wasn't my fault.

The food was great and AMAZING service from Charity!!! Well definitely be back....she was awesome!!! ","If I could give zero stars, I would. Service is awful awful awful AWFUL. 45 min for chicken nuggets and fries.

",I am so disappointed with this place. I saw the reviews but still decided to give them a try. The food was fine and the pricing was bad either. The service was TERRIBLE though. I will never give them another dime. The staff was rude and we didn't even get our drinks or even water until after the food was served. I really don't even know how this place in in business. They really need to upgrade their staff and get some new training.," dont do it. i love tacos and if you do to then go somewhere else. horchata was warm?? carne was bland, salsa was mild as ketchup, pastor was bland, the mf bill was sooooo high",This place was awful!  How do you screw up tacos?  The tacos I ordered tasted old and disgusting.  The staff isn't very nice either.  They always seemed rushed and are in no mood to help.

Tons of protein and veggie choices and sauces too.  On to the grill and a few minutes later we were chowing! "," This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl. Many different meat choices, lots of veggies, and some very tasty sauces. Your food is cooked on a big grill, and normally comes out very quickly. The staff is always very nice to me. Will be coming back soon! "," Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it.    Watch out for coupons, they have them often. ","Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken.",This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree.,"This was a fun place to eat,  you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations.  One thing i really liked was the ""starch""  options. They offer noodles and rice,  but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced.",So far the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. I'm from India and moved to San Francisco in 2009 and I'm visiting family in charlotte. I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well.,Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me.,"They have an interesting and wide selection of food to choose from, which is really neat. However, the quality of the food is only okay, and I'm not sure I can recommend going here.

The service has also always been friendly. "," Excellent and fresh ingredients, make this a must go to for tasty sushi.  Staff is friendly, but restaurant is a little small. ",Salomon teriyaki is perfect with a reasonable price. Especially at Monday. Rolls are amazing too. Waitress and chef look kind and polite.," The salmon is of excellent quality.  Good service, Reasonable price..  Will keep coming back and definitely recommend it to my family and friends, ","This is a nice little cozy restaurant for an off work weekday lunch, lazy weekend lunch, or regular evening takeout. It is open 7 days a week, for lunch and dinner, but the above mentioned times are when I usually come to eat. The place sits about 25 people, so if you have a big group, you might not want to consider this place.

The lunch specials are pretty good and the fish are pretty fresh too. For the price you are paying, you are getting a very good value in quality and portion.","My favorite sushi joint hands down. At work, we'd go for the salmon sushi special ($7.95) every Tuesday for lunch. The sushi is always fresh and prepared at the perfect temperature. I thought I never had real salmon until this place. The chef is also super nice and sometimes gives us free hand rolls or extra sashimi slices.
After years of thinking it's only worth it if it's AYCE, this place changed my mind about sushi.",Came for dinner tonight. My first time here. This place is alright. Nothing amazing in my opinion but it was not bad either. Prices are reasonable for a Japanese Restaurant of average quality. I wouldn't travel far for this restaurant. Come if you are in the area and want some relatively cheap sushi.," We have been coming to this restaurant for years and it has always been a great experience. The owner & waitresses are friendly & attentive, and their fish is always fresh. Decent prices and good service!","The food here is terrific. I order something different each visit, and they always satisfy with fresh ingredients and quality Japanese cuisine. Service is friendly and amenable every time I come in, and the owners themselves are quite welcoming, too.

When I come down for spring training I always drop in!!," This place is awesome!  I am in love with the Twitch coffee bean they offer.  The coffee is smooth, no bitterness and styled to perfection.  The service is great, they pour your latte/cappuccino personally for you.  There's a Starbucks on every corner, it's nothing special, but there's only ONE Press!  I would drive across town for my Press....and I have!!  Hey when ya got a hankering for a twitch, ya gotta go!!! "," I liked the vibe of this place. It reminded me of a few coffee houses I visited in Seattle. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Be careful with the ""toddy"" though - it's fantastic but will get you wired really quick! "," I am used to some good coffee roasters in L.A. so I am a little picky.  It was o.k., but nothing above average.  Latte art - check, nice Scottsdale Quarter mall - check, great taste -  meh....could be better,  friendly employees - check.  Not sure where roasting is done because I could not see it or smell it on the premises.  I did not feel an indie/hipster vibe as Jessica M. stated.  It seemed like run of the mill Starbucks to me. "," Yummy coffee with a personal touch. Not like the conveyor belt at Starbucks or Peets. 
Friendly staff and very good, rich coffee. "," Always super friendly! Locally owned. Bomb cold brew. Offers periodic classes on coffee knowledge. Keep on keepin on, press. "," Decent coffee, helpful staff.  I work at the Scottsdale Quarter so I visit Press regularly.  I don't particularly enjoy their brewed coffee as it has a funny after taste but I do enjoy their expresso. Their Apple Pay was broken and I didn't have my wallet so the cashier allowed me to pay later, great customer service. "," Press just reopened after a quick remodel - they advertised a new capability - nitrogen infused cold brew, so had to give it a try - wasn't a huge fan of the cold brew the last time, and, while better with the nitrogen infusion (makes it look and feel like a freshly pulled Guinness), it's still not my cup of tea...er...coffee.

I'll go back to my old standby of cappuccinos or shots of espresso.

Also, love their Twitch beans for the Jura machine at home.",The staff here and friendly and helpful. They offer classes if you're interested in improving your coffee knowledge!

The service is always good. The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum! "," Hadn't been there in several years and after this visit I remember why, I don't like onions or shallots in my macaroni and cheese. The food is good but not worth the price just a very disappointing experience and I probably won't go back "," My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary (literally every year we have been married). The service is exceptional and the food quality is top-notch. Furthermore, the happy hour is one of the best in the Valley. In addition to excellent drinks, they offer free prime filet steak sandwiches. I highly recommend this place for celebrations or a nice dinner out. "," I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there. "," Very good steak house.  Steaks are high quality and the service was very professional.  Attentive, but not hovering.  Classic menus and atmosphere for this kind of restaurant. No surprises. A solid option, but not a clear favorite compared to other restaurants in this category. ",Had a wonderful experience here last night for restaurant week. Had the filet...

The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!," The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood, which is good, which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious.  Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix.  Bacon wrapped scallops were very good, and I sacrificied a full steak (opting for the filet medallion) to try the scallops.  I asked for medium rare steak, but maybe shouldve asked for rare...my cousin had the ribeye and could not have been any happier than he was :)

Its an ultra romantic place to, fyi.
the wait staff is very attentive. "," Donovans, how can you go wrong.  Had some guests in town and some fantastic steaks paired with some great cabernets.  Really enjoyed my filet and lobster.",The steak is the must have dish at this restaurant. One small problem with the steak is that you want to order it cooked less than you would at a normal restaurant. They have the habit of going a bit over on the steak. The drinks are excellent and the stuffed mushrooms as appetizers were amazing. This is a classy place that is also romantic.

The whole process from ordering, choosing toppings, and receiving the baked end result was quite a breeze. I loved that they had eggs as one of their topping options.

-MKWJZnMjSit406AUKf7Pg,"You guys are crazy.  Maybe your regulars and just love it.  Good for you.  We are regulars in Gilbert at a number of places and I have been to just about every worthwhile wine bar, tapas place, or cocktail lounge in AZ and a lot of the west coast and this place doesn't compare.  The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.  I ordered a burger with no cheese and of course it has cheese.  No dairy, a simple request.  Made another and it was practically raw.  I should give it 1 star but whatever.  Won't be back."," I am smitten with the Barrelhouse. Justin, Eric, and Sandy made my experience wonderful. They had a flirty menu of cocktails that played sultry, sensory  games in my mouth....providing me with a balance of flavors and the tastes of true mixology. I was impressed with the staffs knowledge and passion for all things mixable and drinkable. Haha. I recommended these guys for their unforgettable spirits,  fine conversations, and an immeasurable  quality of service. Simply sweet. "," I'm so happy to have tried Barrelhouse! Stopped there for lunch today and had the Harvest Salad (beets, blue cheese, candied pecans, jicama, and field greens) and split the chocolate pot de creme with a friend. Heaven!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and it was easy to forget we were in a strip mall in Chandler. This is my new favorite place. "," Since our initial two visits, we've dined several more times. Often, Diana is our server and she is fantastic! She addresses us by name and very pleasant to talk with. We will continue to visit Barrelhouse. "," We had several craft brews and the waitress had a ton of knowledge. Great draft beer selection. Ordered the burger.......amazing. It came with the garlic fries. Location is terrible, never would have found this place without yelp. Thank you yelp, we will be back!!! "," I tried this place for  the first time last Tuesday night with my girlfriend. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Justin the bartender made us the most incredible drinks,..he is a master at his craft. The food we had was absolutely amazing!! I will be back. "," Superb dining experience. From the thick cut potato chip snack, the warm cheddar bisquits through the salad of field greens with candied pecans and blue cheese, to the duck confit and lobster baked chili rellenos, everything was a feast for the tastebuds. We hardly had room for the white chocolate and raspberry bread pudding but couldn't  leave without trying it- we were not disappointed. Barrelhouse ranks among the top restaurants in greater Phoenix. "," It kills me that this place is closing! That location is cursed! Thank you to the owners and staff for the delicious meals I've eaten and tasty drinks I've drank, I will miss Barrelhouse greatly!!","Barrelhouse is an amazing place to eat or drink with people you love.  The food here is delicious.  One of the most delectable items on the menu is the Harvest Salad.  It has blue cheese, lots of greens, pecans, and other stuff to give it that great flavor.

Drinks are pricey and food prices are what to expect for a $$$.  $8 for domestics is a little crazy," Overpriced, very mediocre Italian. Given the choices in town I would avoid this place.

I had to wait 15 minutes before someone even saw me inside the store and they weren't even busy! I usually get the same coffee and today it was just not very good... Very disappointed....,"Customer service is always more important than the food quality, that's why I give it 1 star. I was in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee (there was more ice than coffee) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice. I guess she thought I was stupid and that I wouldn't notice. So I sent her back to take out more. Do the job right the first time and you won't have to do it twice. I guess she didn't think I would notice that she didn't even take out any ice.",My frozen hot chocolate was delicious but they only cream cheesed one half of my bagel. I guess it's my fault for coming to a donut place and ordering a bagel lol,Totally disappointed in this Dunkin Donuts as I purchased my coffee from Dunkin Donuts every single morning on my way to work. But today after a late lunch I decided to go grab a coffee I ordered one large Almond Joy iced coffee weighted at the window for 10 minutes just for someone to come to the window to collect my money after the lady came and collected the money we sat there for another 5 minutes just to get one coffee there was no one there there was no cars in front of us we were the only car why was the wait so long.,"I and my girlfriend wanted morning coffee, and we found it in this place.

The poor girl at the counter was taking orders, getting the donuts and she is was responsible for making the drinks. Poor girl...

My Carmel Machiado was BOMB!!! "," My review is for the late evening . If you come in with an hour before closing, the donuts are old and stale. They must stop making fresh donuts early in the day and just sell what is left over. The donuts are heavier and denser that K Creme with less flavor.",Awful Dunkin Donuts location. Service is way too slow for what you order. It feels like you're waiting forever. Seems the staff here are way too busy to even care. They mess up orders too.

We did takeout but will come back and have a sit down meal. Highly recommend!!,Very authentic Italian food.  Great ambience  and excellent service can't wait to come back again!!,"Never got to try the food which sounded amazing. Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers who walked by and got themselves drinks instead or the person on the phone who saw us and didn't acknowledge us either. There was also a customer wandering around trying to pay her bill with no one coming to help. 
Perhaps if they fix the wait staff we will try again. If this was a problem in an almost empty restaurant I can't imagine what it's like when it's crowded."," Had a lovely time here last night with my girlfriend. The inside interior is very cool and modern- a good retreat from the heat of Vegas. We ordered the mussels, Quattro Stagianno pizza, and the Alla Vodka Pasta with meatballs. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, but favorite was the alla vodka pasta!! It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure.

Affordable and realistic pricing. They have a well rounded food menu of traditional Italian dishes. We'll definitely be back! I only gave three stars because the server was rough around he edges. I'll assume that it is because it is a new restaurant and they are just getting on their feet. Excited to go back and try again!," Came here a few weeks ago right after it opened.

Peter was a super friendly server. He made lots of conversation about Jeeps and was very amiable. 

I had the Hickory Cheeseburger cooked medium well and it good. Good mashed potatoes side and the appetizer buns are great!

Other than that, good place.",Food is pretty good but I question the quality. I don't think it's exactly fresh and not sure how they are storing their food in the back.

Ordering take out next time!",Met my bf of 3 years here.  Was always my favorite country bar hands down.  Had a few friends in town and we wanted to take them here... We literally walked in then out.  It smelled so bad.  Barf & piss was the only way we all could describe it with really sticky floors.   The smell was so bad wasn't even worth it to hang outside.  We wanted to be inside dancing.  So we all left immediately and we were bummed we could not enjoy ourselves where we once met.  Really sad for us and hope it turns around because after this and talking around I've heard just hasn't been the same for a bit now.," I wish I could give no stars! I don't ever write reviews but I went there this past weekend and first of all they ran out of bud light, no big deal but the whiskey lemonade was terrible and customer service was even worse. The manager Ryan was not nice at all. He completely ignored my friends and I when we were just trying to get a better tasting whiskey lemonade. When I asked who the manager was he slapped my hand and told me he was and too back off. Then proceeded to ask the guys behind us in line what they wanted. I immediately left, night ruined. "," I have given this place a try on more than one occasion. I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend. This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar. If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place. ","Do they play country music most of the time? Yes. Do they have a mechanical bull? Yes. Do they have two-step dancing? Yes. But are they a country bar? Not exactly...

Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time. They are also open on the weekend till 3 am.

Check it out!",Wasn't impressed.  Walked in on a Sunday around 5. There were 4 people in the bar. Bar was dirty. Was going to order food but decided against it due to the mess. Had the apple pie moonshine. Flavor was good. Served in a shot glass. I understand it's a college bar but my friends and I wanted to have a drink not act like retarded frat boys. Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend. Not a place to go if you want to sit and catch up with some friends and do a little Sunday funday social drinking," In my option, this is a very good spot for country music. One thing i notice about the bar staff the prices are different ever time. I would clean that up because Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will take them out of business.  The mechanical bull is fun way to bring in business "," Went to this bar last night and had an overall great time. The guy out front who cards people was very friendly. There was good music playing, the male bartender made me a random drink & it was delicious! I think the drinks are over priced, though. The bar got really crowded. There was a fight but the bouncers were SO quick to stop it, it was impressive!","Pretty basic bar. Claims to be country, but country it is not. I've been to real country bars and it's completely different. The atmosphere here is mostly college students and the bar itself isn't the cleanest. Yes you can hear country music in the background, but it just feels like you're walking into an everyday bar once you look at the staff and patrons. Can be pretty bad on service too. Not recommended.

The owners also have another restaurant very nearby, that operates under the name Afton Pub & Pizza. I think Afton Pub & Pizza has better food and recommend it over Afton Tavern.

Parking can be problematic since there are many other businesses and the YMCA nearby. ",Don't order the fries. Found a black bug in mine. Manager came by and gave us a $20 Clift card to come back!  Nope never will.," I really like this restaurant! We have been here a handful of times in the past year and have never had a bad experience.

I'll have to remember to go there one day just for the cookie skillet. :)","Looks really nice outside although inside not as nice. Not saying it's bad, just externally more appealing. When it's busy there are too many kids running around though which might annoy some people. Food is so so here, not the best you'll find in town, but good enough.

"," Well, tried many sushi resto in Toronto, compare to the others all u can eat, this is my favourite one, cuz the sashimi and sushi is good, and also the BBQ. I like to go to this resto as its taste is fairly good. Recommend. ","This is a brand new sushi restaurant that just opened a few days ago. The service was excellent, the place looks great and inviting as well. 

My brother and I tried the volcano roll which tasted amazing! The AYCE weekend lunch costed about $16.95, it was definitely worth it.","Good place on a good day, terrible place on a bad day. Service seems to be getting worse and going downhill. The portion size is small and they take a while to bring the food out. The price itself is ab it too much for what you get.",Rul0Ak4oovn2_66iHxtLtA,DC07lZfXaZjq1kNzxOgZPQ,h7D2e8G5VV-4Unb-QHJAlA,B3-r2YuYphl120JypHMnWA,TZEUAZ0awvkbWwvkdsp6Bg,9sU_00RfEqqjB5jrSAV8Aw,9vsKENfmAVvW8nivsr2pIA,T8dAzyKmz7rBGWJy2nQ3sw
0XHMciYfPq7HzEiLCknaCA,Stumbled across this place by chance looking for a customer. Excellent find. Fresh ingredients made to order. Tasty potato salad. Hit the spot.," Not very familiar with the food around town but found this sandwich place and was pleasantly surprised. I recommend the pastrami sub. Very high quality meat, delivered fresh daily, with fresh vegetables. Odd location but fantastic place for lunch. ","Definitely a 5 star sandwich joint!

Had the classic italian and wow, was it delicious! Also sampled the pastrami and the flavor was amazing. I really love how soft the bread is as well.

The service was as good as it gets, and they even asked how we liked it. We felt really ""at home."" 

I really hope this place blows up big time. And I will definitely return."," Small non chain deli, way better than the chains in the area.

They make a really mean hot pastrami, it is so good that I break my adventurous habits and order it each time.

The sandwich is a good size for the price.

Work goes here most every Friday and no one has ever had a sandwich that they would complain about.

I love the fact that it is small and non-chain, plus the staff is super happy and friendly. ","I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I kept missing their business hours. They extended the hours to 5pm and I made it this time! The sandwiches are HUGE and loaded with flavor. The place was very clean inside and the woman who helped me order was very sweet and informative. I think I found my new sandwich shop! Thank you woods family!"," This is one of the better sandwich shops I've been to! It's family owned, which is awesome! I always get the italian when I'm there and my boyfriend gets the joey. It's always clean and the employees are always friendly and very helpful! ","Stopped by for lunch while having my car serviced at an auto shop nearby. The sandwich was one of the best I've ever had!  Everything was very fresh and amazing!  It is a tiny bit pricey (which is the only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5), but still worth it. I would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to stop by.","Food was good however I was a little disappointed at all the extra ""fees"" on the receipt. .35 cc fee .50 for horseradish .75 for au jus ( that she offered). I would recommend letting people know of all the extra charges BEFORE hand.","This place is an outstanding sandwich shop!  There are so many amazing options.  I try to get something different every time, but I really love the pastrami!  Its filled with flavor!  If you're tired of the competition and want something new, this is the place to go!",ISQOdqa8SfBWG8nCLQmdCg,dKLKEpMY4M78ScuoiTd1ug,H8VwBmC7X7f-fOTkQrRXOQ,xLnvpZAeWHo7YHpcCEQ8cQ,iBbgUVUX-qZjE4CnY8WboQ,uBps5z1luwoaTP3ZbAV5zA,nqdwPsTWdVi84JlEq8h-Pg,ITGCtgp52A2TKj54J8mKxQ
5PZefPGncZH6AWMqPY2m9g,Great facility and great service. My son and his friends (11 years old) really enjoyed the lasertag game. This place is very clean. I will definitely return to Battle Blast Laser Tag.," A well run establishment that is great for birthday parties, Battle Blast has a large arena with plenty of targets, easy to use equipment that is in good repair, and several videogames for the kids to collect tickets.  The birthday parties run very smoothly and the pizza is from Seattle Dan's.  I was disappointed in the pizza which appeared to have been reheated or kept in a warmer too long.  The only other food they have is wierd looking sliders and frozen fried foods. However the cake was very good.

They have plenty of discounted days and pay one price nights.  
Overall a great place for the kids. ","This place is pretty great.  Their unlimited days for $20 is a great deal.  Sometimes people are way too serious about the game we call Laser Tag.  I fell once cause I'm the clumsiest human alive and this man 20 years my senior stood over me and kept shooting at me.... I'm 22. This guy was not a dad - just there.  Regardless, super great place when the creepy men are busy at home watching their computer screens. :)","Came here for a birthday party yesterday and my kids had a great time.  

-Staff were great, super friendly and attentive.  
-Food Pizza & cake was ok
-Soda unlimited refills ..Their retro soda dispenser is cool
-Arcade games ok selection. Wish they had more baby friendly games or those .50 rides to keep them occupied


Laser Tag
-Great 2 story lay out!! Honestly the best I've seen yet
-great equipment
-Viewing DECK! Love this!  You can see them running around in there through the upstairs viewing deck. Pretty cool"," Such a fun place to have a birthday party. They took care of everything, and the kids had a blast. Fun arcade, helpful serving staff, fun for all ages. "," Quite easily the best Laser Tag place in the valley.  And by far the coolest arena.  People who work there are totally awesome.  Not to mention they actually keep the place clean.  Great for people of all ages.  Plus they often have specials... such as family play packages, so big families can afford to play.  Tag for tots once a week, and then Wednesday and Friday nights they have all you can play special.  Super Awesome. "," Our friends had an excellent birthday party at Battle Blast Laser Tag. For many children, the laser tag games were their first time. The parents felt comfortable. Each child enjoyed the food. Wonderful service. The staff was friendly, kind and they were really good with the children, especially in the laser tag game. Thank you for a wonderful weekend. ",Great place for teens to go hang out. Nice service. Good deals. All in all great place.,"Nice place for birthday parties. They have an arcade and offer pizza, cake, and soda, as well as laser tag. Plenty of activities to keep everyone occupied and the staff are nice and work well with the kids. The equipment is in good working condition, and it is a clean facility.

I was in town visiting my sister and we just yelped this place. What a gem! My lashes are so soft, feminine, and natural looking. They totally make my eyes pop! I got my lases done 3 weeks ago and they still look so full. I can't be more satisfied. I definitely will come back to Winnie the next time I visit!","I love getting eyelash extensions by Beyond Beauty Lashes! I was introduced to lashes by a good friend of mine that have been coming here for over two years, her lashes looked awsome. I've been coming to Jenny for about 6 months now and refuse to go without lashes which make my eyes look soo pretty. I have volume lashes that are super soft & fluffy. I've never had a problem with them glued stuck together or take any of my natural lashes off. I'm addicted!!!","Found their service through Groupon. I scheduled my appointment on Sunday and almost forgot about it. I went to get my lashes done hungry-as in starving since I woke up late. The whole time Jenny was doing my lashes my stomach was growling. I mean, all I can think of was food and donuts they had for the customers.

It took about 45 mins and my lashes was awesome. Jenny was friendly and professional. Will get my fill next time. They were awesome. Okay, my ramen is here- time to eat."," I wish there were an option to give ZERO stars!! This company has a terrible product, and even worse customer service! They made a mistake on my lashes, and admitted it, yet will not correct their mistake nor refund me. You are better off throwing your money in the street and having a child apply eyelash extensions than to visit this business. ","I absolutely love this place. I've been going consistently for over 6 months and have never left unsatisfied. I always ask for Winnie, she's great! Everyone is skilled there and I highly recommend them. Since I've been going to them I haven't put on one ounce of mascara, you won't need it and you will still look fabulous, trust me. Thanks Beyond Beauty Lashes!!!",Xuan and Jenny are very sweet and are very good at what they do. If you have any concerns or questions as far as your lashes they are there to help. The experience is relaxing and peaceful. I would definitely recommend going to beyond beauty lashes to get your lashes done.,What an amazing shop I had my lashes done by a tech from California....my lashes look beautiful...now she wined and dined me....she was just in Vegas for a few days to help out. With that being said I'm sure the rest of the girls are as qualified!!!," Greetings all!

I love how they :

*are always on time!  
* offer drinks, snacks and magazines on the waiting room
* are fast (BIG ONE)! 
* great quality lashes and amazing suggestions

The shop is clean, all equipment as sterile and fresh and Terry was professional. The only small drawback was the price for such a small piece; probably the most I've ever paid for a tattoo. Otherwise, good experience. Would certainly go back. ",came here on a Saturday after calling to inquire about a septum piercing. I spoke with Ryan and he was very knowledgable and friendly! I came in later that day to complete the task. I was greeted by a very sweet blonde named Maddie. she helped me pick out the perfect jewelry even though I was extremely indecisive. the piercing was a breeze! I didn't feel a thing. this place is amazing at what they do and I will be sure to return! (:," From Heidi: Justin is the bomb, he provided exactly what was wanted. Great line work.

0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g,Nice place for good food when you're in a hurry. Italian food but in the same fashion as Chipotle. The pasta bowl with Spicy Sausage is a favorite of mind. The Italian Sodas are a perfect combination to the hearty bowl!!,This is the worst piada i have been to. They were out of several ingredients and shorted me on the ones they did have. There avocado was way over ripe and there salsa was mush. The servers paid no attention to my order and had to correct them numbers of times. Will never be returning here and do not recommend,If chipotle had a stupid Italian cousin it would be this place. There food is awkward.," I've come here a few times before and never had an issue until tonight. The staff was rude, the store was out of several ingredients key to several of their offerings. They moved super slow. It was overall disappointing. "," Disappointed. Plus, we were waiting in line and the electricity went completely out. I went to A Piada a few years back and it seemed way better then. Feel like it's gone down hill since the first time I visited. ","Pointless to order on line,  staff unapologetic for delay.  Order was to be ready at 3:45 it is now 4:03 and is still being prepared.  Should have gone to the Beachwood location"," Was curious about this place.  Pasta was hot and tasty.  Menu was complicated and difficult to navigate.  It would take a few visits to get it right.  Being from out of town, I don't know that we will seek it out next time. "," I used to love Piada, but this particular location is abysmal. On two separate occasions now I've not been greeted when I entered. Now, even if you are busy, anyone with half an ounce of experience with food service etiquette should know to at least greet the customer, and if necessary, let them know you will be right with them. My food the last two visits has also been cold. The lines get long.  BOTH of my last two visits there was some issue with the cash registers as well. I will NOT be coming back to this location.","This place is kind of weird. The food menu is odd and doesn't make much sense. The food can also be weird, as in it doesn't make much sense some of the combinations used. I wouldn't order online because they don't seem to get it immediately and your order can be delayed.",go6dY3St6iuEdba9G_PDKA,0zg2Dtcc3EVluKANUbeFeQ,zBzWWSk4sW0W1mhNjyzN1w,o7knPF_Gaf10ui3xJk80vg,9sesJy1Pi2Q7D9gXXDgljw,hheJPfg_UhUrEqExBJpFxw,E6k0HQxN4SZ3_-CTXrTcHA,Zf6GknXIYWYTjYLShyV9Kw
4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"Food is very good, service and atmosphere really poor. Best to get take out. The rice and beef kabob was really off the charts. "," Best kabob in town, I wish I could give more stars! This is authentic afghan food, great choices and great food, I will definitely come back! "," Perfect in every way! The spices, the tenderness, the doneness. My oh my! The portions are super-generous, and the price is amazing. Wow! It also does not hurt that the people there are very nice and friendly. Will definitely be added to my favorites. "," Yum! Hubs brought home ""to go"" order. Super delish! Lamb, beef and chicken seasoned and cooked perfectly. Rice absolutely scrumptious.

I've picked chicken kabob teka, the dish was delicious and the plate is pretty big.
In addition to great meal I've been enjoying the family business atmosphere- I appreciate a lot this part in restaurant business! Generally, if you want to enjoy real authentic Persian dishes- Pro Kabob is the place number one in town. "," Wow......This place is the bomb. Have been here three times. Now have an addiction to the chicken kabob, with brown rice. Put this place on your must do list. Peace out. "," Food is ok and definitely not PERSIAN.
If you are craving Persian kabob go somewhere else. It's not even close to Persian kabob. "," Good food. Nice people. The beef tikka is definitely juicy and delicious. Bolanee is also fresh and yummy. The dough is prepared fresh, filled with potato or squash stuffing and seared. Enjoy!","This place has a excellent price point, and the portions are generous.

4c19YWOjPmbFUK4-V2GEvg,I've only eaten appetizers here but they are awesome. Huge portions- one app is enough for 1.5 meals. Appetizer happy hour is the way to go. The drinks are probably good- there's a very creative selection- but I'm not a drinker so I don't know for sure. Go upstairs if you can- cuts down on noise and cluster.," Went here yesterday, my girlfriend ordered a blue moon draft. After taking a sip of the beer ahe noticed a dead fly in it. We told the waiter and he quickly got her another beer. Nothing was comped on the bill which i find pretty absurd.... "," Food is decent, and the drinks are ok. Not a hugh selection, but not bad either. The staff can be a little salty though. "," As a teacher you would think I would love this place and it was nice that the food was named after books. But the place was Full I mean full of hipsters. Plus we had to sit upstairs  and I didn't really like that. The food was okay, nothing to die over. "," I really love the idea of this place (menus taped inside books, book titles for menu items, green lamps, etc.)! The menu isn't really big (just salads, sandwiches, and pizza) but everything is good and the desserts are good, too! ",The bald bartender is the worst I've ever seen. Clearly he got the job because he knows someone.," It's ""i eat"" I guess. 

Food is nothing to WRITE HOME ABOUT LOLLLL BOOK PUNS!!!!!

That being said, maybe it's just the stuff on the appetizer menu cuz like I had a well made salad for lunch this one time u no??

Service is fine.

They have some aiiiight beers on tap.

Definitely above average for pub food but so good that makes me want to...RE-READ IT???? "," Trivia on tuesday was fun, and the half off apps during happy hour are definitely a reason to come. The wings and quesadilla are my favorite. The beer selection and happy hour prices are also a draw, and you're encouraged to try any of their eclectic beers before buying, a very cool option.","This place is just ""meh.""  I wish the menu had more options.  I ordered the pizza and it looked burnt.  The bartender didn't know any actual drinks other than beer.  The atmosphere overall wasn't very clean.

1_Dg-GguWatioW4mvFQKQA,Great sushi and very friendly staff (even the sushi chef and owner asked how my meal was) but the SiriusXM Love station was brutal to listen to.,"The sushis were nice. I especially liked the Dragon Roll from the 8 sushis we tried here. We tried the Dean's, Dragon, Veggie, Rock and Roll, twister, American Dream and two others. I could say the dragon and rock and roll were among my most favorite ones but the veggies was probably the least favorite.","We went on a surprise date to a new place.   They were totally packed and had 2 servers on. Maybe a call off and that happens. But our server could barely get to us and just dropped food and ran. If she really looked, she would have seen we didn't eat one sushi roll.  The Dean. Pureed and super fishy. 

The Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great. 

We left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service."," I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.  Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good.  I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy. ",Stunningly bad... Not sure what else to say but if you're seeking edible Japanese food run in any direction but this place.," We really like this place--super friendly owner and have never a wait for a table.

Reasonably priced generous sushi boats that are excellent. I despise mayo and this is the one sushi restaurant where I don't have to worry.  The house salad dressing is very good and the udon soup bowls are a perfect warmup in winter.   The green tea is made with leaves and not tea bags which is a nice change of pace.

Win. ","Sushi with great mouthfeel, well-executed rice, but not a ton of flavor.

I ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan.) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness/acidity from the dressing.

The sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet. Rice was of good execution.",Wonderful sushi ver much more on the traditional side. Worth checking out if you're in Pittsburgh.,They have a long list of meals but the sushi is wonderful and top of the list for things to get. The staff is very friendly and helpful but rush around a bit . The owner is also friendly.
