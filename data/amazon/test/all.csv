cloth	B000A2FTN6	These are the perfect tights for my 5-year old. The tights are very well made and have already lasted several washings (hang dry). The color is beautiful, and my daughter loves that she can wear flip-flops to class like the big girls do.	my 3 year old fit into these perfectly. I love these tights, they are great for wearing sandals to dance class and then pulling them over her toes to put ballet slippers on. They are nice and soft and the pink color is pretty. Will purchase again.	These are my daughters preferred ballet tights. They fit well and don't squish her toes as much as some others. The convertible option is nice as she can wear flip flops to the studio with her tights. I like that they appear to be fairly durable.	Bought this for my little one to use for her ballet class. She's almost 4 and this fits perfectly. Transition tights give her the ability to pull up the foot area to around the ankles so that they don't get dirty when not wearing her shoes, but fit well and stay in place when pulled over her feet and used with ballet shoes on.	Great soft fabric, runs small a though. U should consider getting one size up to avoid having your daughter, or son if he's into ballet, have little circulation. Don't get me wrong, great product and material.	I purchased these tights for my 4 year old because she has a tap class immediately followed by an acro class. Tights fit well and were easy to transition to bare feet after tap. I can't comment on how they hold up, as we only had one week of dance so far.	This is my go to tight when my daughter needs new ones. I won't buy anything else. They are super comfy and last forever! She is 7 but very slim and these will fit her for a while but the 8-12 is a better fit for longevity purposes but they only had this size left and I needed them right away.	These are great tights. If your girl is chubby on the waist i think you should order a number up. they are a strong tihgts. My daugther has it for more than 4 months and hasn't broken them. She only complains some days about the waist, just when she has had a lot of milk or food recently. she's 3 years old.	These tights are great. They are durable and do not tear easily, they can be worn and washed without worry. The bottoms of can be pulled up easily so that sandals can be worn with them. It might be a good idea to order a size bigger because they can be a little tight in the waist. Overall, these tights are definitely recommended.	These transition tights are perfect for children sensitive to the tight sensation other tights have around the foot.  The material is soft and durable; they stand up well to both the rough nature of children, and the washing machine.  This product does tend to run slightly small, so purchasing one size up is recommended.	Bought these for my 3 year old daughter for her classes and they turned out great and fit perfectly. She can pull them up to walk in then pull down to cover her toes for class. Strong tights that should last. You might need to buy a size up just for comfort around the waist.
cloth	B0013EQ20Y	i really like these boots. they can be a beast to get on, like any boot fit to last; once on, they are incredibly comfortable. I have had them for 4 years and they still look great - worn in but not worn out...	What great boots! They do take some breaking in - like all real leather does. Run maybe a tad small in the general spectrum, but hey, remember the break in period. Look fabulous, will last me for the next twenty years.... They bridge the fashion vs. function quandary beautifully.	Every woman needs a pair of these Frye boots! Fit is true to normal size. I wear a standard 9. These fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as I do. You have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in. Worth the money and break in time.	Boots excellent quality, beautiful skin, a modern model. But! they are very narrow! This is the second pair of shoes is a brand and my 8.5 size fits me perfectly, even he little more than usual. But these are very narrow! go to a cobbler, let him try to stretch. Be careful!	bought these for the wife to have something to kick around in and keep up with the kids, but she doesn't like them. Her heel lifts with every step, and they're stiff and heavy. Not an everyday casual shoe.	Don't get me wrong, they're really good boots, but they used to make them better. My last pair from a few years ago were much higher quality. Thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. Keeping them, but still disappointed in Frye.	i bought it just for the heavy snow cuz my UGG got wet through.even though it is a little expensive, but the boots are nice and it was shipped to me for only two days.!!!!!! i love it	They were comfortable the moment I put them on. The sizes are exact. The color the way they are made are what I expect from Frye which I've been wearing since the 70's. With a 20year break from not wearing Frye it was a pleasant surprise the quality has stood the test of time.	Nice boots but run a bit narrow. They look great but I think the quality has come down over the years. Still comfortable but I wish they broke in easier. I recommend these for any lady who is patient and looking for comfort.	These boots run fairly true-to-size, but they aren't super easy to get on at first. They're comfortable, but a short break-in period is needed, at least in my experience. They look great on and they're very durable, but they are not the lightest boots you can wear. As long as you aren't expecting feather light footwear, this shouldn't be a problem. They are a nice blend of function and fashion and that's not always easy to find in boots.	These boots are great, excellent quality, incredibly comfortable and the sizes are exact. It's a little expensive, but will last me for about twenty years. The shipping was fast, two days. I love it.
cloth	B001QCZ3E4	This shoe is very classy and chic. The colour is rich and goes very well with almost any navy blue outfit. However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader. And you do have to order the size a 1 / 2 inch bigger than you normally wear.	this shoe was picked by the 'bride to be' for her upcoming wedding this weekend. The other bridesmaids paid over $80.00 in a dept. store. I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly.	I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area.	These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable.	These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute.	I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!	These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable.	Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for. I'm five months pregnant and needed a comfortable shoe for a wedding and these completely fit the bill. I would buy again.	Very pretty shoes and nice quality. The shoes run a bit small, about half a size and there is a ridge in the shoe that rubs on your toe. Nice formal night shoe, not so much for every day.	Great fast amazon shipping. This shoe is very chic, classic and with a rich color that blends with almost any navy blue colored outfit. I love the look of the shoes and would be forever special to me. There is a rim inside the topmost part of the shoes that could cause blister to my toes.	These shoes are best fit and nice looking for parties or specially for wedding functions. The toe of the show can be a challenge for some feet and may make the feet sore due to the rim to keep the shape perfect. Overall price wise and looks are great and would recommend for long term use.
cloth	B002AROW78	My son is 3 and this fits him perfectly. He'll probably be able to wear it for the next two years if he'd like. It's cute too. The hat is thin, but completes the outfit. And the candy pocket is huge. Perfect! I'm so glad we bought this costume over any other Thomas costume.	I ordered this for my 3 yr old for Halloween. He loved it!! The candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. I was very pleased with the way it fit and everything.	Received from Toynk Toys and was very disappointed when I opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric. No 3D sculpted face that I expected. I became creative and added huge googly eyes, pumpkin patch, spiders, bats, and train tracks to the outfit to make it a bit more suitable for my taste.	This is a cute costume that we got for my lil cousin and the candy pouch is basically the size of the entire costume so that's p cool. I doubt it would fit up to six years old like it's advertised as, but it's the perfect size for him (age 2)	My son looked sooooo cute with this costume on. It was well worth the price in my opinion because, his face light up when he seen it in the package. The whole night he kept saying to the doors he got candy from 'me the train, chuchu!!'	I ordered this costume online and it was perfect for my 20 month old son's second Halloween. It was comfortable and he loved the pocket. The size was perfect because it didn't need to be a particular fit. He loved the hat too. Every house we went to trick or treat complimented the outfit too.	My 2 year old loved this costume. He went on the Halloween parade at school and everyone said it was very creative that he has his own candy pouch as part of his costume. He also went around the neighborhood and was pretty popular with his Thomas the train look.	I was pleasantly surprised at how cute this costume is in person. My 3 year old son LOVED being Thomas for Halloween, and the candy catcher was a great feature. It also looks like it will grow with him, so we may use it again for Halloween next year if he's still Thomas-obsessed!	What an impressive Thomas the Train costume! It will fit any train loving toddler for at least a few Halloween seasons due to its roomy design. The candy pocket on the front is an adorable touch. And it's so stinkin' cute! Absolutely worth the price.	This Thomas costume is really cute plus it is comfortable and fits well. My child liked that it has a pocket and a hat. It even has a candy catcher. This costume fits well for a two or three year old. The hat is thin but it is completes the costume. My child loved being Thomas.	This Thomas the Tank Engine Halloween costume looks very cute, and fits well for children around two to five years old. It comes with a large, built-in pouch for hands-free candy hauling. The only potential issue is the fabric seems a bit thin and flimsy. Nonetheless, I would recommend this.
cloth	B0040EIHQQ	This pendant is so unique!! The design is beautiful and the bail is a ring instead of the typical bail which gives it a nice touch!! All the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.I cannot say anything about the chain because used our own chain.:) Satisfied.	It look perfect in a womens neck!! great gift, I thought for the price it was going to look cheap, but I was far wrong. It look great.Spect great reward from your woman when you give this to her; D	The prettiest sterling silver piece I own now. I get so many compliments on this necklace. I bought it for myself from my hubby for Valentine's Day. Why not? When people ask where I got it, I simply say from my loving hubby. And he is off the hook as to what to get me. win + win.	I love hearts and I love 'love':) I do not have any negative feedback, the necklace is perfect and the charm is perfect. I just thought it would have been slightly bigger. Overall, I love my new heart necklace.	When I received the package, I was surprised and amazed because the necklace is so elegant, beautiful and the same as the picture shown here. I really love this necklace. It has a unique pendant designed. I will recommend it to someone to order it now...	Item is nice. Not a great quality item, but right for the price. Charm was larger than I expected (I expected small and elegant, but it was large and almost costume jewelry like). I think it is a good necklace, just not what I expected.	I got this as a present for my GF on Valintines day. She loves it and wears it every day! Its not cheap looking and it hasn't broken yet. The chain hasn't broken either even though it is very thin. Strongly recomend it!	Over all service has been great the only problem, I ordered a purple Mickey Mouse case for iPhone 4S they sent a black, n I felt it was to much trouble n such a small item to send back so needless to say its put back in a drawer somewhere	The necklace is very unique and a great quality for the price.  The charm isn't exactly what is pictured as far as size goes but still very beautiful.  The chain is a bit thin but seems to have good durability. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking to add a beautiful piece to their jewelry collection.	This necklace is beautiful and well-made for the price. Even though the chain is thin it hasn't broken. The pendant is really nice, but it is hard to tell the size from the photos. It would look great around the neck of any woman you get it for!	This necklace is a beautiful and unique piece to add to your own or a loved one's jewlery collection. The pendant is unique and the bail is a ring making this sterling silver necklace an elegant looking piece. It has a very strong chain also so it can be shown off and enjoyed for a long time.
cloth	B004X86A86	I chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. I had to return it, I couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it.	I hate this bag! It's horrible, it's the worst bag I've ever got! It broke the first day I got it and didn't even carry it! It's definitely not the size I thought it was!	I like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. Its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. I would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off.	Love this! pretty size: not to big? not to small, color and shape! and very flashy. Everyone loves it! all the stones were on it when it arrived at my house and only one fell off as i was trying it out!	I have had this purse less than a month and now ALL 3 straps BROKE!!!! Worst quality ever!!!!! Had to throw it away!! 40 $(after shipping) down the toilet!!	i bought this purse and was worried it wouldnt come as it said in the ad. when it arrived at my home i was more than extatic when i saw how nice it was. i am actually very impressed by this purse, and reccomend it to any one looking to spice up there out fit. looks great with boots and leggings!	I was all about this bag and then when ups brought it I was not to happy, the bag is way to small the straps are to short and one of the straps was broken.so I will b e returning or give it to my daughter to play with.	The bag is A LOT smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. However it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it.	This purse is well-designed in terms of appearance, but not in terms of usability and reliability. It is smaller than advertised, the straps are flimsy, and the decorations fall off very easily. It works well if you're just looking for a fashion statement, but if you want something practical, I'd look elsewhere.	Purse looks great. The bag is cute and flashy but the size is smaller than expected overall. The stones and straps are not very durable and break or fall off easily.	This purse is pretty and the material looks great! Unfortunately, it is smaller than I hoped and a few of the straps have fallen off. So have a couple of the stones. I wish it had stayed together because I would have loved to use it more.
cloth	B005085X5Y	I looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. My head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! I have returned it.	Loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. The best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. Provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions.	I needed something for my cruise to Hawaii. I ordered this atthe last moment, but Amazon came through and I receivedit the day before I left. I love the look, the feel, the factthat I can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, I received compliments on it.	I spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. It kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. I have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all.	I wear a hat anytime I am outside for any length of time. This hat is cute and provides great sun protection. I have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to Butterfly World with my granddaughter.	Good quality hat, I love that I can be protected from the sun, and look good too! I'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when I accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. I have already ordered another hat for my daughter.	I bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. They are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. Love the UPF protection. The only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. I think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase.	It looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. I wear it while gardening or for walks. I got it in the Moss Green and the color is as shown online. I'm glad I bought it.	The hat is comfortable, stylish and easy to pack into a suitcase for travel. It protects well from the sun, keeps the head cool, and is suitable for both boat trips and more dressy occasions. Sizing is 'one size fits all' which seems to be good on even large heads. The customer service was great, ensuring the product arrived on time before travelling.	This is a really cute hat that even folds well for easy packing. It is large enough to protect my face and my hair from the sun with UV protection. I received many compliments on this hat. It fits well on stays on nicely at the beach and it made me fee so much cooler on a hot day.	This hat looks great and does the job! The one siz fits all really does fit and the stitching design looks great while protecting your head and neck from the sun's UV rays. It also can be rolled up and packed without messing up the hat as it unrolls and still looks great! Just make sure you hang on to it if your on a boat so it doesn't blow off your head! This is definitely a product you wont want to lose!
cloth	B0052PKEYK	Although the quality of construction seems adequate, the sizing isn't accurate. I ordered a size 34 which is the size I normally wear and the suit not only pinches around my legs but also is almost uncomfortably tight around the waist.	The suit seemed ok in quality however it was the wrong size. It is always a gamble buying online even following the sizing chart. I did return it and got a refund but Amazon failed to fight for the sale and make it right. I went to a local store and purchased what I liked.	Fits well and has a nice draw string to keep them tight. I bought a size small so that I would not have to worry about them falling off but I should have bought my correct size as they fit true to size.	The only reason for the 1-star reduction, is the seams around the legs are pretty stiff and tight. However, the seams appear to be loosening up a bit though with use. I typically wear a size 32 but had to get a 34 for this suit.	The size on the waist was correct, but if you have large thighs like I do, or should I say muscular thighs, it will be a tight fit. It is very tight to get past my thighs, then it wasn't so bad. The waist was a 38, no problem there. It will be a tight fit on most guys.	I got this swimsuit a month ago. I swim 5 days a week for about an hour and 15 min. I washed the suit after every practice. It tookabout 2 weeks for a fabric to loose all elasticity. After two more weeks the suit basically fell apart. Avoid!	I wear a 32 and I read some of the reviews and yes it does have a nice feel and fit but does run small with that being said I ordered a 34 and it was a nice fit and feel but I think a 36 would have been a better fut	I haven't swam in it much yet but fit is good. I bought two different styles. Both were speedos. I am not a swimmer so this is a first purchase of speedos. Training for my 3rd marathon and wanted to add swimming as part of my workout.	The suit fits ok on me, it is good around the waist but tight in the legs/thighs. I will probably return this and move up a size, it's easier to use the drawstring on the waist than deal with a swimsuit strangling my thighs. Consider a larger size than normal if you have large thighs.	This suit is a good fit for me. It may fit tight on guys with large thighs. I like the feel of this suit and the style is good for anyone swimming as a workout or doing any real training. It may run a bit small though it does seem to stretch at the seams with use and wear.	The suit tends to run a bit small as the fitting in the waist was adequate but it was tight in the thighs. After heavy use the seams tend to loosen up and even loose the elasticity over time. Overall it's a nice suit, has a nice feel, and is nicely constructed.
cloth	B005BQ6YYO	Fit as expected. Have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. Looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. These work great for me but not for all day use.	The shoe is so comfortable and I bought another 'walking' shoe by Ahnu which is perfect too.Needed a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in Europe this Spring. These will fit the bill.I found this style was a little big so I had to get a half size smaller and it is great.LO	Reviews said to buy a size smaller. I wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. It was still too big, and I'm guessing a 6 would fit. I bought the Ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6.	I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size.	I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right.	I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly.	I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!	I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight! I bet I could run in these. Great all around casual working shoe.	"This is the perfect ""comfy shoe,"" great for walking around town or casual get togethers. Cute and functional!  They do run a bit big, plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual. Another very comfortable shoe by Ahnu, would definitely buy again!"	These shoes are lightweight, comfortable, have plenty of support, and are slip resistant. They're great for walking and working, and they look quite nice as well. The only issue is that their size measurements seem inaccurate. You may end up needing to get a size that is either smaller or larger than what you normally get.	Nice, lightweight, comfortable shoes for casual use like walking- if they fit you well. Sizing is confusing, tends to run large and not fit well on wider feet. Expect to need 1/2 size to 1 full size smaller than your normal shoe size.  Try these on in person if possible!
cloth	B005DO7R3G	I usually wear size 37, but found a 38 feels better in this sandal. I absolutely love this sandal. So supportive and comfortable, although at first I did get a blister on my big toe. Do not let this be the deciding factor. It stretched out and is now fabulous. I love it so much that I bought it in three colors.	This is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. The strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but I have very slim feet. I can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet.	I love these sandals. The fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. I don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. They are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses.	My wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. We were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. Some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. We gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them...	Finally, a Dansko sandal that's fashion forward! It was love at first sight! This is my 4th Dansko purchase. Their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. I love the stying of this sandal and I'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. Another feature I love is the Dri-Lex topsole - it's soft and keeps feet dry.	I really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as I have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. I'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears	I have several pairs of Dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. So I felt confident when I ordered the Tasha Sandal in size 39. I don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. Otherwise, I love them. They are very cushiony and comfortable!	I own many Dansko shoes and these are among my favorites. They have ALL the support that Dansko offers in its shoes plus they are very attractive. I love the the heel height and instant comfort. They look great with slacks and dresses, dressed up or not...	I love these sandals, Dansko has made a really great product! I had to return my first pair (39) for being a bit tight and small, but I went a size higher (40) and it is perfect, they are so comfortable! If they do stretch out like other reviews say, they will still fit and look great.	I love these Dansko Tasha sandals! They are comfortable and the style is really cute. The only warning I have is that they seem to run narrow: you may want to buy a larger size if you have wide feet. Also, they seem to stretch as you wear them, so don't get discouraged by a few blisters on first wearing.	These Dansko shoes are amazingly comfortable and hug the shape of my feet well, but I did have to wear them for a bit to stretch them out. They felt a little tight at first, but now they are perfect. I feel they're true to size so I'd recommend ordering these in your normal shoe size.
cloth	B006QM4HOG	I really appreciate the method of safety built into this bag. But, it is so large that by the time you put all of your stuff in it, it is hard to carry. Certainly could not carry as a cross bag easily. If someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground!	it is light weight and has many compartments. I wish it was just a little larger. There is a 400 item which is too big-rhis is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; I would like to see the company make a 300 series.	I love this bag although I would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. It is light enough that I can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my Kindle. I love this particular shade of blue. It goes well with most everything I wear. I also appreciate the pockets for separating things.	Took this bag on a recent trip to Europe and it was great. No worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. The two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella.	I checked this on two different monitors before I ordered. Both looked more rose color. It's very much a dark purple. Which I'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up	Wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an AMAZING bag. I couldn't believe how much stuff I got in there on a recent trip. Comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. Love this bag.	I used this for the first time last week on a trip to Maine. We normally drive so I was worried about carrying things on the plane. This handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. I love it!	This is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips! Seriously, great purse and yes, I paid a little bit more for the mauve as I was tired of black. I just love my purse!	This bag is lightweight yet very roomy. It has plenty of pockets for storage and organization. The safety feature makes it perfect for traveling although you need to keep the contents light to use as a cross bag. It comes in black, blue and mauve although the mauve looks like more of a purple.	This is a wonderful bag for traveling, especially if you are a heavy packer. The many pockets will help keep you organized. I would not purchase this bag if you don't have very many items to carry around, as it may be too large. Overall it is great if you need a large traveling bag.	I love this bag! It was exactly what I needed for my trip to Europe. It has all the pockets I could ever need, and I was able to fit my phone, camera, snacks, maps, a guidebook AND my Kindle, plus everything else I would normally carry while still being comfortable. The color seems a bit different than I remember, but overall it looks great.
cloth	B006UF64CW	I get constant compliments on these sandals. I order them every summer in a variety of colors. I had heel spurs and back problems so the cushy softness of these is the only thing I can wear comfortably and the small wedge heel is perfect for my back.	These thongs are fun, festive, flexible and surprisingly comfortable. I have very sensitive feet and I can wear these cuties all day. The arch support is great and there is a nice give in the sole. I love these so much I want to put a few pairs away in case they discontinue them. They go with everything.	I have been wearing White Mountain beaded sandals for a couple of years now and they are wonderful. They are lightweight and cushion the feet when worn for long hours. They are also beautiful and usually hold up for two or more seasons.	This was great price for this cute sandal. Unfortunately, the toe piece was very hard and they were a little narrow... unusual since I normally wear a B width. For the right person, they would probably be fine. They just didn't work for me.	I love White Mountain sandels. this is my 2nd pair of these shoes. I wore out the last pair after 2yrs. They are very very blingy and I like that. Would I order another pair? you bet I would / will.	Item was too small, purchased for a friend their size 9 is smaller than the size 8 in the store. Sent it to the wrong address, and I can not seem to find anyone that will tell me where my bill is. I will never buy from white mountain again.	I lived in sandals that looked exactly like this but I thought they were by Bjorn. I couldn't find them anywhere, but found these (go figure). While they aren't quite as comfy as my other ones, I think with a bit of breaking in they'll be just fine. Lots of compliments every time I wear them.	Not only are these SUPER comfortable (yes, even between your toes), they look great with just about anything I wear! I have been complimented on these daily!! I typically wear a 6 1 / 2, I ordered a 7 and they fit perfect!! I need more of these!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	These sandals are beautiful, fun, festive, and come in a variety of colors. They are light weight, comfortable sandals with great arch support, but run a little small, so buy the next size larger for a good fit.	These White Mountain sandals look very nice, people will take notice of them. They are comfortable but it may take some time for your foot to adjust to them. The softness can help with your back and arch support. They also hold up to extend use fairly well. Recommended for the right person.	These sandals are both very comfortable AND very stylish! They do run a bit small, so you may want to order 1 size up. Overall, a great shoe that you'll enjoy, even after a couple years of consistent use! HIGHLY recommend White Mountain sandals.
cloth	B007I8G8A8	Love the shorts! Fit beautifully and look great on my hunky hubby! We grew up at the beach and these are definitely back flashes!! Excellent quality, good material, made very well and am very excited! I need to order him more!	As other people mentioned the liner in these are SUPER small. I took them on vacation to Hawaii and on the second day I cut out the bottom of the liner. The waist fits fine but the liner inside is not sized accordingly. I just cut the liner at the bottom so I could be comfortable and all was well after that.	great price nice style these were the best swimwear available during the winter season and compared to the others that i found online these were very sharp (style) and also the price was very decent if your son needs a pair for gym or just swimming i would recommend these to any one	Shorts have a good look and feel. Fit about as expected but the mesh is a little tighter than I'd like. (6 '205lb, wear a size 34 waist and ordered the size large which is quoted to fit a 34.) If you're on the fence, might want to go a size larger.	My wife said I had to buy a proper pair of swim trunks for an upcoming cruise. Seems my use of cut off jeans would embarrass her on the cruise we took. The pockets are deep enough to keep things in and the cargo pockets are good for keeping various items like sunglasses.I guess I will have to retire the cutoffs.	The shorts themselves fit well, but my husband said the inner lining was a little tight. He ended up not wearing them because he was worried about them chaffing. Hopefully they can be stretched or fixed, but I'm not sure.	This is a cheap product and it shows in the material and craftsmanship. The material is rough and it has one of those annoying net liners built in. The stitching seems poorly done and I don't thin it would have lasted long had I actually worn it out into the ocean. I returned the item.	This was an excellent purchase - very sharp looking and seemingly well made (so far anyway) for a great price. What garners only a 4 star is the mesh inner lining is a bit too tight and i had to cut it	These look very nice on.  The mesh in them run a little tight though so you may want to go up in size.  They are roomy in the pockets and can hold onto a lot of items.  They are a great price for the quality and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new pair of swim trunks.	These swim trunks look great and the waist fits as expected for the size. They are also a good deal for the price. However, the inner mesh liner is much smaller than the size of the outer trunks. You will probably have to cut out the mesh liner to wear them comfortably.	These are nice fitting shorts but the mesh liner felt tight and I cut it out. You might want to size up if you are unsure. The deep pockets come in handy. These shorts are stylish and they look good. They are more comfortable if the inner mesh liner is removed.
cloth	B009L0KU46	The shoes are the perfect fit for me. They supply the support that I need yet are flexible and comfortable. I wear these all day in my 2nd grade classroom and my feet are not tired at the end of the day. I will be buying another pair in a different color.	I overpronate and should have known better than to buy these shoes. They are really sharp looking and probably would work for someone with a regular feet. I wish I could have kept them as I did get lots of compliments at the gym when wearing them;)	It is very comfortable and the bottom is really soft on my feet. I usually wear 8 but I had to get a 7 in this. So it ran large for me. I have wide feet though too. Very stylish. I enjoy wearing them running and casually as well.	Got a blister the first time wearing them. They did nothing for the foot pain experienced from wearing cheaper shoes. Guess I was expecting too much, but I refuse to pay the ridiculously high prices charged nowadays. I'm sure they are just as good as those costing $100 more. Nice colors!	These shoes are awsome. I have a really hard time finding running shoes due to a high arch and the need for a shoe between a neutral shoe and a stability shoe These shoes felt great right out of the box. They run true to size and the colors are great. Great shoe for a great price.	These are a MUST HAVE item...!! They are totally awesome on my feet and feel like a dream. I do a lot of power-walking and these little cuties are RAD..!! Totally light weight but real cushie..... LOVE EM 'and would DEFINITELY buy from this seller again..!!	I usually wear a size Women's 10. Nike shoes run small, so I usually waer an 11 in Nike. These Reeboks fit more true to size, but I still ordered a 10.5 and the fit is great! The shoe seems durable and well-made. It forms to my foot and supports my arch very well.	She loves the shoes! My girlfriend is picky about shoes and avoids online purchases. I asked her to find a pair of athletic shoes that look attractive. She gave me her size and I purchased them. They are lightweight and she says they cushion her feet well. She has been wearing them for long walks and tandem bike rides since she received them!	These are lightweight, durable and supportive shoes. They look great and the cushion is quite comfortable. They are perfect for people who have to stand on their feet all day. They feel lightweight on the foot and are great for people with regular sized foot. However, they may not work for someone with very wide feet. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone who needs a supportive comfortable shoe.	I love the look of these shoes, and everyone in my walking group has commented on how great they look! I took the advice of others and ordered a size smaller. They fit just right and are very comfortable. I walk for two hours, 4 times a week, and these shoes have been just what I need.	I love these shoes! They give me great arch support and are very well-made. They fit pretty true to size, but make sure you utilize the sizing chart listed. They are perfect for my daily walk. I love the color. I did get a blister the first time I wore them, but that always happens to me. They just need to be broken in. Now they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had.
cloth	B00AZ6WVQU	The description say it long... NOT so it is average. That's why I purchased it because it said it was long. This is a basic tank.I washed it and it didn't warp but did shrink a little. Nothing to brag about.	I'm 5 '4 'and this tank fits like a normal tank top, not any longer. I was trying to find a tank that would cover past my hips, so I could wear it with leggings. Don't order if you're expecting tunic length.	This shirt is OK if you are layering for sure. It is THIN and runs SMALL. I usually wear a small and read the reviews and ordered a Medium. It fits tight and is NOT long like in the picture. Glad I only purchased one.	The tank fit very well and was comfortbale to wear. The material was thinner than I expected, and I felt it was probably a little over priced. I've bought much higher quality tanks for $5 at a local store.	The only reason I'm rating this at two stars is because it is listed as a 'long' tank top and the photo even shows it going well past the models hips, however I'm short and the tank top is just a normal length.	I usually get them someplace out but they no longer carry them. I thought I would give these a try. I received them fast, although I did order a brown and got a black (which I also needed a black anyway). They were a lot thinner than I like but they are okay.	Every women should own one in every color. They wash well perfect under everything. Perfect alone. As I write I'm waiting on another of the same style to arrive. Just feels quality I don't know how else to explain it, but I'm sure you get it ladies!	I bought this tank to wear under shirts when it is colder out. I bought one in white and one in an aqua blue color. They are long enough that the color peeks out from under my tops. Looks cute. I do wish that the neck line was a bit higher cut to provide more modest coverage of my chest.	Women's tank top fits well, runs a little small, but of good quality. It's a thin weight tank, great for layering. It comes in many colors. The only negative is that it's listed as long, but is actually a very standard length. If you want a regular, basic tank top, this is it.	overall not recommended product. the tank top is smaller and shorter than expected, so keep that in mind and order a bigger size. the cut on the chest is too big as well. but the product is good if you are going to use it for layering.	Great tank top to wear under my other shirts as I liking layering and the material has a good feel. There was a good choice of colors to pick from. Although, the top is a thin material I don't mind since I wear it under something else.
electronics	B000BYGGBW	Yes, HP DVD's are DVD's for the better. Better price. Better quality. I have used these over the years for many different projects and the quality is there and so is the price. I have had trouble with some other brand named DVD's, but not with HP.	Ive always bought the Hp DVD + R 100 pk and find that they go a long way, Seldom do I find a coaster in the pack... Hwever his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from Amazon, but so far so good.	I have had a ton a problems with these discs. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. Looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and I guess picked again. Do not recommend.	The box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank DVD in place was broken and DVD were off the spindle. If that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all.	Produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on DVD players. The first half was about what I expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. The second half I was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. No good!	After receiving this DVD + R, I think I should order the 50 piece spindle. I did not burn too often. I believe it is enough for 2 years. I tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it.	Been purchasing only HP DVD + R media for 8 years or more. Always got the HP branded gold coated. Made by CMC, with id of CMCMAGM01001. This batch is not gold as portrayed in the photo, it's silver coated, but still the same id.	Vendor describes the product as being gold in color. It is not it is silver. I know that HP no longer manufactures the gold version.But was hoping this vendor had some gold version of DVD + R in it inventory. They need change the picture and description to silver instead of gold.	These are silver discs, not the gold ones as advertised. The packaging is not good, they need to be packed more securely, the DVDs shouldn't be able to slide around.  The quality of the DVDs is hit or miss. You might have a good batch and then run into several that won't work.	I've always used HP DVD + R discs, but these are silver instead of the gold they used to be. These silver ones are hit or miss. I'll burn 10 DVDs no problem, then get a few coaster in a row. I wish the gold DVD + R were still around. I'm glad I bought the 100 pack in case I have any other issues.	These DVDs work well for the most part, although I did get some coasters. Some seem to work but become choppy about 30 minutes into the video. HP is still better than most other brands though. Take note that these are silver, not gold. Hopefully the vendor updates their images.
electronics	B000EB7OTU	Since I purchased this backpack a month ago, I have used it several times. It protects my new SLR camera and I can still put water bottles on the side, food and a jacket inside. Additionally, it is very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it.	I have this same model purchased from B & H. This one through Amazon is missing any sort of padding at the bottom of the bag. Basically your camera is sitting right on the ground with a thin layer in between it and any surface. Ridiculous and disappointing.	The main clasp for the bottom part isn't perfect... it's slightly bent and requires some manipulation to 'click.' The tripod's great, the cleaning kit's great. Be careful about that front clasp. It was shipped quickly though.	I like this bag very much, it can hold my SLR body along with 2 lens, even with one 70-300mm, although bit hard to fit in well. I would expect it little bit bigger, however current size looks perfect if carry out for causal travel. And the bag is good quality and solid. Nice backpack.	I found that this was too small for my D90, 70-300mm and 18-105mm. While it all fit in the bottom of the backpack, there was really no room to spare for future equipment. I wanted to use the top for personal stuff, so that I did not want to put camera equipment up there.	I recently bought Tamrac Adventure 7 backpack for my Nikon D80, and I used it during my vacation trip. I like it very much. It is well designed, the material made is durable, and practical pockets to put your camera accessories. I recommend this backpack. You'll get your money's worth.	I had at least two camera bags before this one, and never found the perfect fit.What can I say... I just LOVE this backpack, is comfortable, excellent size and does not look as if you were bringing a super camera.I would buy it again and strongly recommend this model	Great Backpack! It is well made, padded straps and back. I have a Canon 20D with grip and about four smaller lenses in the bottom. I do have to keep my Canon 70-200 2.8L in the top section with a lens wrap around it.	This is a sturdy, durable backpack that's functional and comfortable. There's room for an SLR- sized camera, and also room for a few personal effects, although it does lack much room for extra equipment. Will work perfectly for a casual day trip.	I love this bag,  purchase it a month ago, it was shipped quickly. It is well designed, comfortable to wear with a durable material. The tripod and the cleaning kits are great. I recommend this model and would buy it again. It's worth the money.	This camera bag, constructed as a backpack with padded straps and back is functional and comfortable to wear as well. It is roomy enough for the camera plus several accessories, and also has enough space for extras. It is well designed and made of durable materials. I would recommend this camera bag to most people, although some users with a lot of accessories may need more space.
electronics	B000V7CPJG	I recently bought this film and slide scanner to scan my grandfather's slide collection. It bleaches out the image with too much light. I tried changing the settings to improve the image quality, but had no luck. The company ArcSoft charges $10.00 per phone call for tech support. You are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner.	* * Not Reccommended * * Purchased as a gift in August. Opened a week ago. Spent the last week trying to get Win Xp to recognise the Vu Point scanner. Many drivers and reloads later all I have is a little black box with a red light and a message from windows that says 'USB Device Not Recognised'.	I used the VuPoint Digital Scanner to scan over 1,200 35 mm negatives and about a dozen slides and found this gadget a most user-friendly and efficient tool. I even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. I recommend the product highly.	While the software was good for Windows XP and Vista, I now have Windows 7 and would like to have software for the newer operating system. The company prefers to sell other products rather than update their software. I can't see recommending this product in today's market.	While most equipment will work with more modern versions of Windows than were available when manufactured this is not true with this scanner. Requires Windows XP means it won't work with earlier OR LATER. Its on its way back for a refund.	I found the VuPoint scanner not acceptable and I am still waiting for a replacement. My contacts with VuPoint were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. My contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.I an NOT anxious to deal with these providers again.	Product is very easy to use. Does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. Touch-up and enhance program gave me just what I needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, Company was great to work with!!	Its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you. I'd much rather buy a hp flat bed scanner that lets you see the final photo image and not just an image of the negative. It takes to much time and isn't worth the money.	overall impression of the product is negative. in some cases it works nicely, but the settings are confusing to adjust, sometimes it is not clear if they do anything at all. product is not worth the money that it costs, it better to avoid it.	The product is easy to use. It converted to digital format my slide and photo negatives. Very efficient and user friendly tool. It is mostly compatible for Windows Xp.  The product is not recommended for today's market.	I seems that the VuPoint scanner seems like a good product but between the inconpatable software and trouble with placing the negatives in, many customers dont have the time and want instant results. i would give this scanner a good review if you cant afford a more high product. you wont get a better enhancement feature on a more higher end scanner. Give it a try or return it if you dont like it
electronics	B001H9O71Q	Basic GPS unit for those of an older age who do not use smart phones. The screen is small but for the price, a very nice unit. Touch screen and color graphics are a nice touch. If you are looking for the no frills, basic navigation system, save $50 + and buy the 'One'.	I'm a novice at electronics, and there are too many processes to go thru to get to what you want (to get to your destination) - once you figure out all of the buttons to push - it's a beautiful thing...	I got this because it was a deal. I should've known TomTom has a funny way of making you forced to update maps, and in LA a lot of stuff changes so you may as well not even bother with this thing. I use this now as a back-up gps. I just hope this thing does find if and when my phone dies.	Works great. Easy to use. Sometimes may try to take you on a weird route. Still have to have an idea of how you want to get somewhere so that doesnt happen. But, it will always get you to where you want to go.	I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it. She has her own business and must do a lot of traveling, this has been a great help to her in her travels. She is very pleased with it and I am so glad I got this for her gift.	I got a great deal on this TomTom. Not the latest technology (screen size, touch screen / talk options) but had all the features I needed (full street names big visuals). It hasn't dissappointed yet! I would recommended this to anyone.	very easy to set up and use! arrived about 2 days sooner than expected. i didn't even have to read the manual to figure out how to use it. i also like the speedometer on it (my car's speedometer isn't working).	I have purchased this nit back in 2011 and after couple month the battery kept dying.After researching this problem, it appears there is a known bug that the gps wakes up by itself and drains all battery.No firmware update ever resolved it.Avoid, not recommending, seems like a widely known issue.	It's a great deal, also easy to use and to set up. It has a known GPS bug and may sometimes try to take you on a weird route. Not the latest technology, but have all the features I need. I would recommend this to anyone.	Overall a great gps for the price, simple and easy to use. Makes a great gift for those not comfortable using a smartphone. May not keep up with the latest map updates, especially in a big city, so keep that in mind when using.	This GPS is easy to use and fairly inexpensive. As a backup unit it is nice to have but sometimes the map is not up to date and you will end up on a different route than intended. There is also a bug where the battery drains due to the GPS unit waking itself up and is an unresolved issue. This of course does not mean every unit is affected by this. It is easy to use and works great when there are no issues. For the price and accessibility it is recommended but with caution.
electronics	B001TKE25E	Good quality, everything that you need is included (except for the gang box of course). I'm using it with 16 AWG wires (they say they are 14 but I know better than that). It should fit 14 and maybe even 12 AWG. I'm not using banana jacks.	Cant give it 5 stars because the mounting screws that come with it are poor quality and will strip easily. Do yourself a favor, head to the hardware store and get the # 6 - 32 1 'combination machine screws and throw out the ones that come with this product. The white trim screws are OK, but not great.	cost much more from local retailers plus is a better product. some of the newer designs suck. plastic inserts don't try it if it says easier dont't buy it. this product works on old school. some times that's the best way. take a little longer to instal but no going back for loss wires	This is OK product. looks good and easy to install.Cons: Cover is not a standard size and you probably wont be able to replace it. In addition it does not flush everything completely (not deep enough) and there is a small gap left between the wall and the plate.	All the screw heads were painted shut. I had to dig them all out before I could screw them in. The rest of the plate is ok but I didn't enjoy spending a bunch of time digging the slots out of the screws. I'd recommend going with something else.	Bought five for my 5.1. Installed into the boxes in the wall well. 4 stars for having a slight gap between the wall and the plate after install. I only notice it at slight angels. Jacks are made well wires attached well.	Easy installation and looking nice. Much cheaper than brand product at local store. However, it doesn't look as nice as the brand ones either. I suspect the connectors are made of poorly gold-plated bruss or even other metal. But for my purpose and for the price, it is OK.	Came individually packaged, with mounting screws. The backing plate is plastic, but sturdy enough. Plastic is great for me as I live near the ocean and corrosion can happen. Great quality. Great price. Much cheaper than local home improvement stores.	This plate is plastic and comes with mounting screws. The screws are a bit stripped and difficult to work with but this product is a good deal cheaper than those at local stores. It leaves a gap between the plate and the wall but overall it looks good. You could use different screws other than what comes with this plate.	This mount is cheap, installs easily, and works well for most applications. It looks good, and the plastic is sturdy. However, the included screws are of suspect quality and may need to be replaced, and the back plate doesn't fit snugly against the wall. Overall, good for the price.	This is easy to install, and comes with everything you need. However, the mounting screws aren't great quality and it might be best to replace with something else.  It's much cheaper than branded products, but as it isn't a standard size, the fit might not be good on some walls.
electronics	B002RL8IGI	Took a long time to get and when I finally got them, they didn't seem to work to well joined up (I have 3). Also, they should have come with DC chargers, they don't seem to work well with batteries, imho.	The units work fine and the setup is described in the manual works well. The one thing that my wife and I do not like is the Audio. Sounds like you are in a box. The calling button is also a bit strange. It first beeps and then you can speak. The distance it covers is very good.	Don't waste your money on these. Although if you try hard enough you can make out what the other person is saying, the audio quality is extremely poor, as is the noise cancellation (if any), and the general sound quality. I wish I had saved the boxes. I'd be sending these back.	And the problem is having to wake the kids up in the morning to go to school. They are upstairs and I used to have to trek up and down a couple of times each morning. We put one in each bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the study. Problem solved.	We use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold, but that is about all it is good for. Don't bother trying to have a conversation, clarity is too poor. I didn't realize until after the fact that I should have just bought walkie talkies. At least battery life in these are good.	I searched extensively for an intercom for my large two floor home. I selected this unit (ordering three units) and regret my decision. It was very difficult set up and doesnot work that well. I wish I could get a refund as we never use it. My search continues.	It is simple to program and operate, which is just what I was looking for. I just wish I didn't have to buy a power cord separately. I am running it on batteries right now, but I am not sure how long they will last.	I've spent hours already trying to set up my network and get this system going. The engineering leaves much to be desired. Can't get it to work as advertised. The Manual is one of the least helpful such documents I've ever seen.	If you are looking for a basic intercom system and nothing fancy, then this product is for you. It is perfect for what I need it for. They do not come with cords, so make sure you have batteries. It has a good range of coverage. All units work well, and the setup was easy as described in the manual. They are simple to use and my kids love them! Great product for the price.	These intercoms are not worth the buy. Getting these set up is quite the hassle and the instruction manual is not much aid. The worst part is that the sound quality is very poor. This may have some use if a simple message is to be sent. Otherwise, don't waste your money.	This does not come with an AC charger so you have to use batteries or buy a cord separately. I think this covers a good distance and the battery life seems good. The audio is not great, it is not very clear. It is challenging to set up. Walkie talkies would work about as well.
electronics	B003U8K0N6	This power supply gets the job done but I am concerned about how hot the charger gets after a few hours. I attached a cooling device to the power supply and has controlled the heat. Buy this with caution and monitor the temperature of the power supply.	This charger ruined my laptop. I did not have any problems with my 5month old lap top until i used this charger. Buy this from the manufacture and you will be better off. Go to ACER and bet it from them.	My charger gets hot very quick. The one pictured is not the on received. The prong fits loose in the laptop. The one pictured showed a grounded plug with an OEM Brick. The one received has a 2 prong plug and has a sticker on it stating, replacement AC Adapter, Made in China.It would be nice if the pictures represent the real items.	I recently purchased this power supply and cord to replace the OEM that stopped working. I've had it approximately 1 month and works perfectly. The cord is a little shorter than the original but that isn't much of an issue for me. I would recommend this product.	I bought this for my aspire 5532. It worked for about a week and now it won't charge at all. The fit was never snug from the start, but I was hopeful. I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!	The charger arrived here very quickly! I am very thankful for that because I have online classes to work on for school. The only thing is the cord has to be placed a specific way or it will not charge so that is difficult.	Purchased the product for the corresponding laptop. The adapter made so much noise that I could not charge the computer in the office. After writing the company they took appx 5 days to get back to me and suggested that I send the product back on my dime to fix the problem. Poor product, bad customer service, I do not recommend.	I ordered this for my Acer 5532. It heats up right away and I only use it to charge the laptop, it isn't plugged in for very long. After only 2 weeks it MELTED! This is horrible and dangerous!	The charger gets very hot with use, which can be quite concerning. The fit into the laptop is often loose, which makes it unreliable. Some items delivered didn't resemble the photo online. Overall, it would be best to avoid this product and buy direct from the manufacturer.	This charger gets very hot very fast and it seems a bit dangerous. It has to be lined up a certain way to work. The charger makes a bit of noise. Customer service was not helpful. A cooling device may help with the heat but this product should be used with caution. It is an affordable option.	This product is of very poor quality. This charger is not reliable. It gets very hot and is loud and may ruin your device. It does not look the product in the description and customer service is not quick to help. Overall, I definitely do not recommend this product.
electronics	B003YJ5LLM	Love the design of this sleeve. When I don't have a table I use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. Wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve.	This was bought for our teen daughter for Christmas, the only negative things about it are 1.no strap 2.no pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price.	This case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. I disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. The smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. I love the design and it was a fair price. Shipping was a little expensive though. It arrived quickly and I would buy from this seller again.	I really enjoy the design of this case but I thought it would be lighter. When it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. But the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop.	I like this case very much! It fits my Acer Aspire 14 'as a glove!!! Yes, it smells a little bit but I wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. And it's very cute too. I recommend this product to anyone.	I BOUGHT IT FOR MY ACER 14 ', IT IS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT, BUT THE WORST WAS IT HAS HEAVY RUBBER SMELL, WHEN I LEAVE THE CASE IN MY ROOM, THE RUBBER SMELL WAS FILLED WITH THE AIR EVERYWHERE OF MY ROOM, MADE ME SICK. DON'T BUY IT.	I have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. It's working well though and now I can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. I'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit.	I really love it! It doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well defined.I bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so I don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch,	This 14' laptop sleeve has an attractive design and is made of quality materials. It has a very snug fit, so be cautious of buying it if your laptop is even slightly over 14'. The only real issue is the rubbery smell that comes with it. Overall, I would recommend this, unless you have a sensitive nose.	This case fits so snug around my 14 inch laptop. The quality if very good with draw being well defined. There is a hint of a rubber odor that may be a turn off for some, but the smell goes away rather quickly. A great buy for the price.	This case is a very dark color. It has a good amount of padding. The fit is good on my 14 inch laptop. It has a smell that slowly goes away. Shipping was quick but a little expensive. I would recommend this to others, this product is just as described.
electronics	B004G8EKIA	I did not go wrong when I purchased this stereo receiver. tons of power pushing my system, what an upgrade from my old one, this is a real powerhouse. It pounds. Remote control, quality crafted stereo receiver for under a hundred bucks! I thought it would be good, but did not expect this. A sweet deal!	If you want just a stereo then this will do the manual is very limited. The fan is loud and the USB player will only let you go one track at a time so if you have a 100 tracks it will take time to get there. The sound is fine and is easy to connect up.	First problem I have with this receiver is you can't set the channel presets. Also the speaker wire terminals are NOT clamps and it took me a while to screw them in. The power is good and it looks durable. I don't believe you can play the tv's sound through the receiver.	I got this to replace a 20 year old stereo I had. I went by the speaker specifications when I purchased this one. When I hooked it up, this receiver pushed my 15's more than I ever heard before without messing them up. Perfection!! I recommend this to everyone!	This Amp is very inexpensive and its performance proves its quality. First, you can't play a turntable without buying a preamp. That would be ok if the sound reproduction was good. I would have settled for good. I didn't settle and returned it; you shouldn't either.	Amazon ought to be ashamed to carry this junk on their line-up. You got enough BAD reviews to open your eyes.Just reading the murdered English in their manual is enough to tell you this is made by prisoners. Just try totune to your station on the FM - hopeless. The noisy constant fan! The unreal low price should have been a warning.Shame! Charles	This sound system is worth all the money you pay for it iv never heard bass so clear and ass loud as its going tough my 12 '' and 8 '' and two 5 '' subwoofers buy this if your looking for grate sound.	The Stereo works fantastic as Amp. for laptop Or MP3 player. Radio reception is poor. Has great range of sound adjustment. I have it in my garage, with speakers all around. Use mostly for Sirius / XM radio on laptop.	You get what you pay for with this receiver. Terrible radio reception, very noisy fan, and don't expect any help from the useless manual. It does have decent power, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a quality product.	This is an inexpensive stereo option. The manual is limited and is difficult to read, also the fan is loud. The radio reception is poor quality. The sound quality though is great, when listening to Sirius or when hooked up to a laptop.	This sound system is worth the cost. The bass is so clear and loud, the stereo works fantastic and the range of sound adjustment is great. I had a problem setting the channel preset. Overall, it's a sweet deal.
electronics	B004IV8Y50	I love this item. Im happy that it came with a color keyboard protector. It was super easy to put on and the color is great. I love that you can see the apple logo through it. Overall its a great product I totally recommend it.	The cover is very nice, just it does not fit snugly. There is extra room and unless I am very carefully about inserting the Macbook Air into the cover, the cover shifts around.If iPearl provided a better fit, I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars.	My case arrived before the estimated delivery date and I love it so far. It was VERY easy to put on my MacBook Air. I love the retractable feet; and the color purple that came matches the picture perfectly. Would definitely repurchase something else from this brand.	I ordered two of these covers after careful research and visiting retail stores. These covers were free shipping and were a snap to install. There are no issues whatsoever with them, so order them with confidence. Ignore the extra picky shoppers' reviews on here. Hope this helps.	I do not recommend this item. It's a pretty color, and it stayed on for a while. But the cover pops off the top of the clamshell too easily, and now it is more off than on. I am now shopping for a case from another maker.	I absolutely love the case! It fits my laptop perfectly! I received many compliments on this case with the keyboard cover that came with it! I love the keyboard cover as well. The cover is nice and thick. I love it! I would recommend these products to anyone that wants to protect their macbook in style. Nice sturdy case.	Love the the clip cover. I was pleased with the tilts stands in back. Places computer in perfect angle to protect my wrists. the keyboard cover is nice but taking a little used to the buttons having a different feel. over all very pleased with products. And products arriving in a very timely fashion as stated.	The iPearl cover fits like a glove and gives me just the amount of protection I'm looking for without bulk. It's priced well and showed up on time, as promised. Great product and customer service! What more could I ask?	The covers are exactly what I have been looking for and they are not hard to install.The price that I paid for them was a steal, and the time frame for me receiving it was faster than I expected.  I would give it 5 stars but  it takes a bit of effort to keep it on without slipping.	This case was easy to attach. The retractable feet that makes this a stand are really cool. The color is nice and you can see the apple logo through the case. The keyboard cover is very handy and this product feels sturdy. My case arrived very quickly. Good customer service!	This laptop cover slips on easily, but the loose fit can occasionally cause it to slip off as well. It comes with ergonomic tilt stands on the bottom, making long typing sessions more comfortable. It looks nice and has a good feel to it. Overall, I would recommend it.
electronics	B0051PJHDK	Very disappointing product...... bought it as a present and was not working.We returned it 3 times and they don't want to give you a refund. They only try you to upgrade to their newer version. Customer service is a joke. Pay $50 more for a better tablet it will save you a lot of headache.	I purchased one of these units 2 weeks ago, alas it has to be returned as the battery is defective. I purchased from Abe, s Of Maine thru Amazon and the customer service was top notch except i have to pay shipping to return it but that, s better than a $154 paperweight.	I got this tablet as a free gift, but didn't think it was this cheap! I got the tablet and had it for about 1 month. My kids used it to play games which seemed to work fine until one day about a month after having it would no longer power up. What do I do? It seems like such a waste.	Received tablet 6 days after order was made and worked fine till Tuesday Nov.15th at which time it stopped holding a charge. Worked fine when connected to power but shutdown when power was disconnected. Come on, it should last longer than 30 days. Paid $150 + for a product only lasting alittle more than 30 days.	7 'Skytex Skypad Alpha. Charging is hit or miss but mostly miss. It would have been OK if not for the charging issue. I e-mailed tech support for a charger replacement but no response from them. Hacked Netflix was working but not anymore after Netflix upgraded their system. Netflix issue is notSkytex 'fault.	This product is not worth buying. I bought 2 as Christmas gifts directly from the company. 1 doesn't work properly and the other is just junky. I tried to return the product but they are unwilling to take it back. Waste of your money!	Bought this one for my dad as a gift. Thought he would like it being that it was a tablet... just avoid the discount models, go with one you know they will like. Maybe a good fit for someone who doesn't know much about electronics.	The tablet is not the best in the world but for $150 its a good deal. I do feel bad for anyone that paid $400 + for it because its not worth anywhere near that. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap tab	This tablet has numerous reliability issues. The likelihood of it malfunctioning after a month or less of normal usage is high, assuming it's not dead on arrival. Even considering the cheap price, it's still not worth the money.	This tablet is not worth the money, no matter what they are charging for it. It is of very poor quality and stops working after a very short time. It is especially prone to battery malfunction. Worse, the customer service from the manufacturer is almost nonexistent and it is difficult to return. Don't waste your money.	Buying it at MSRP is ridiculous and in fairness, buying it at a discount presents a huge risk as well. The charging is spotty at best and the battery itself presents a lot of risks. Avoid it until they start caring about the quality.
electronics	B005MZO5TA	Exactly as described, at 8 + oz. of solid metal this grip offers a stable way to hold your lightweight digital camera, without putting you fingers in front of the lens or flash. I find it works well with the Kodak PlaySmart Video camera and the Nikon S9100 point and shoot.Opteka HG-5 Pistol Handgrip Stabilizer for Point-n-Shoot, DSLR and Video Cameras	Probably the best and the least expensive stick I've ever owned and I love it.I use this with my GoPro HD Hero2. It's a bit heavy but the construct is very good. You can use this as a weapon too. lol	Bought this as part of the stabilizer rig then realized that this was easier to use alone than the rig itself. I am going to use it with a camera with an active stabilizer. Videos looked good. Will update after I use it this weekend. It looks good and is built solid.	I use this with a dual-camera mount and I like this because of the heft / weight and it stays pretty secure whether I use it with the mount or on my flip video camera or snapshot. I'd recommend this handle highly.	I was planning to use this with my D7000 + Battery Grip + 80-200 f / 2.8 lens, but when I received it, I changed my mind.It just does not look like it can handle that load. I put it on my Panasonic GF2, and it performs very nicely.Would highly recommend it for lighter cameras.	The unit is quite sturdy. I bought it to replace the pistol grip unit also featured because the pistol grip locking mechanism did seem to want to lock tight. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. A great purchase for the money.	This is the 2nd stabilizer that I've purchased... one for my Sony a99 and one for my Sony a33. I can't speak highly enough about this handy little item! It's perfectly sized and the ergonomics is ideal! Two thumbs up!!	A low cost device that I bought and paired with a cell phone reduce jittery videos. Works pretty well for handheld use even when walking. The thread seemed a little recessed at first until I moved the washer flat. I recommend this product for anyone who records videos often for friends, and family especially with your cell phone.	Exactly as described. Looks good with a solid build and the unit is quite sturdy. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. It is a great purchase for the money. I'd recommend this handle highly.	This stabilizer is perfect for light weight cameras and can also be used with a cell phone to help diminish jitter. You can feel the heft in this stabilizer and know that it will stay secure. It feels weighty and professional. I would say to use caution when using it with larger cameras but it is perfect for smaller cameras. Overall, it is recommended.	A great all-around, sturdy stick for cameras. It is very versatile and quite ideal for lightweight cameras especially, and this stick is highly recommended for its great price-point and overall versatility.
electronics	B005ZA2W42	This product recharges my wife's iPhone 4 with no problem. One downside - it does not have enough juice to charge an iPad. It would benefit from some indication of the percentage charge of the battery. Also, the LED light is VERY bright.	The product is great .The issue is that it came broken and I only found out after I had it for a month. There is no was to call there support. Very very bad idea. Will do more research next time .I don't think I would buy it again!!!!	I bought this to test it out for charging my phone on AT section hikes. For the added weight, it was a nice-to-have item. I probably wouldn't have it on a through-hike, but it worked well and if you aren't going to have access to a power source for recharging your phone while you're out, it does the job pretty well.	This solar charger works perfectly. It can be charged with electricity or solar power making it a great backup for charging devices. For its size I would recommend getting one and putting it in your but out bag for use with e-devices.	I ordered this charger to take on safari to South Africa. It is suppose to charge an iPhone and Kindles. It doesn't work with either of mine. It was a waste of money for me. I'm very disappointed.	Charges up, charges your devices. The flashlight is really bright. I had to take a star off because the charge battery doesn't hold a charge over a period of time. However don't go cheap, this product is worth the money.	This is my first solar charger, so I can't compare it to any others. I will say that the flashlight is extremely bright as noted by others. It seems to do a nice job charging my Droid Bionic but it didn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire.	I left it out for 24 hours in direct sun, the lights on the side showing the progress of charging blindly blinked, but the charge gave my iPod only 1 / 10 of full battery. I tried again and placed it in the sun for 2 sunny days straight, again, after multiple annoying blinking signals, it did not charge anything. Returned.	This solar charger works well at first and charges phones well but does not adequately charge iPads or Kindles. The LED flashlight is quite bright. Performance over time is not reliable as the charge battery begins to not hold charge. A battery charge level indicator would be helpful. Overall, a decent purchase for a backup or travel.	The solar charger is good fit for travel bag. The LED light is one of the best function of this charger as its very bright. Though will recommend this charger to charge the cell phones only as it does not have capacity to charge other devices such as Tablets.	This charges our phones with no problem, but we haven't been able to get a full charge on a tablet out of it so far. It's great for hiking and camping since there is a nice bright flashlight incorporated into it. I wouldn't trust it as your only charging source during a power outage if there is no sun. If the sun is shining, you'll be fine since it can use solar energy to charge. You can also charge it quickly with electricity, if you prefer.
electronics	B00BOZCSQE	of the fact that an SD card is NOT included with this camera. It is essential (you can only take 2 pix with the camera's internal memory) and it is standard practice to include one with a camera. So add c. $25 to any advertised price that you see here. Camera itself is fine.	Sharp pictures. Impressed with the low light capability. Almost as close as my DSLR. Ample shot configuration via auto presets as well as some options. Would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. Adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. Sturdy and slips easily into pocket.	I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BASED ON CONSUMER REPORTS REVIEW. IT HAS MET MOST OF THE REQUIERMENTS. ITS PICTURE QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THE CANNON 110 HS THAT IT IS REPLACING. I HAD TO GLUE A RISER ON THE ON / OFF BUTTON SINCE IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY THUMB	Have only used the camera a short time but am really impressed with all the features and marvel at the detail of almost any type photo situation. The low light feature is outstanding and will be very helpful in museums and other venues where flash is not allowed. Overall I love this camera.	i have high-bride, mirrorless camera which is over 700bucks, but this camera, nikon one is almost as good as my fancy mirrorless camera.. i just love it! light, easy to carry around and pictures are just great. satisfied.	Love this camera for quality picture taking and size. Very easy to use and takes professional photos. I like to take my camera everywhere and this is the perfect size. It's a great first camera to explore with before investing in a DSLR.	After looking in the Consumer Reports for a new camera I came along this one. It was number one on the list.It was a good price so I bought it. It takes a little time to learn about the choices and setting up but then it's easy to use. I love my camera.	The battery is constantly malfunctioning making the camera unusable. I was on a once-in-a-lifetime trip in Malaysia in August and this happened constantly. The on / off button is also malfinctioning, besides that is very poorly designed. What good are all kinds of features when their usability is way below par!?	This camera is easy to use and you can take it anywhere. The picture quality is generally great. Some things to note are that it does not include an SD card and there have been instances of issues regarding the on / off button, they can seem a little small. It also holds it's own against more expensive cameras. Overall this small but easy to use camera takes great pictures so it is recommended with confidence.	I like this camera for its picture taking and size. Takes professional photos and it is very easy to use. It's low light feature is outstanding and helpful in venues that flashes are not allowed. I love this camera.	If you are a beginning photographer and wan good pictures i suggest buying this Nikon camera. it does not come with an sd card which is not cool for the money i spent and they can be pretty pricey. If you need low light capability on your camera , than this is the one for you it seems to have a feature for every scene or situation
electronics	B00DB94FB2	The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted	you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it.	Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!	The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present	I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a $5 adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!	As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product.	My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT! Its so easy to operate by setting the alarm.. I like the way when you put your iphone 4s to the dock its charge at the same time while you are you using it...! Great product	While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.	This FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!	This is a great product. It has amazing sound quality, and the dual-band feature is nice. I love the fact that it charges my device while it's docked. Not only is this thing functional, but it also looks great and doesn't take up a lot of space. Overall, I would advise buying this if your needs call for an awesome speaker that doubles as a charging station.	This is exactly what I've been looking for! It has great sound quality and it's really easy to dock my iPhone in it (it charges my phone at the same time! Bonus) The alarm is easy to use and does it's job. Some iPhones and iPods will need an adapter, so make sure to check that out first.
health_personal_care	B00028QA72	I wanted to get rid of deodorants after reading about the hazards of the ingredients used in them. These crystals do the job. No they do not keep you from sweating. But, they do take care of the odor. Use as directed... after showering and such. I have not bought deodorant in years. These rocks last a long, long time...	This does indeed work and if you are not a heavy perspirer it will be effective for several days. Don't know for sure how long it will last as I've not had mine that long, but for sure it's cheaper than the stuff we've been using for years.	This stuff WORKS. It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn't surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces. I'll buy the stick next time.	I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants. I am very pleased with the results! This works better than any deodorant I have ever used. I will never go back to traditional deodorants. This was money well spent.	I was somewhat skeptical at first in hearing about this product, but now I'm a believer. I purchased a crystal a year ago and it is still working. A little water activates the rock and then you apply it like a regular stick deodorant. I can't believe it works so well and lasts so long.	The product is fantastic, I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers with excessive persperation issues or B.O. It will eliminate both after a few days use. No kidding. However don't buy from this seller, mine arrived broken completely in half and I contacted the seller for a replacement and they would not return my calls.	I love this product! I use it and it doesn't make me smell like cologne or perfume but it keeps me smelling good (like me!) all day. It does not irritate my skin and it does the job. It also lasts so much longer than the stick deodorant I used to use. Better product for less money! A real find!	I have been using this product for over 10 years. It works much better than common over the counter deodorants and lasts much longer. I have never had a odor issue using this product no matter how hot or sweaty I got. Great stuff... the larger 5 oz purchase is the most economical.Highly recomend.	this product is good alternative to deodorants. Crystal lasts a long time. the major drawback is that it is somewhat easy to drop the product and it shatters very easily. overall the product withstood the test of time	This stuff works, fantastic product. I used to doubt it at first when I heard about it, but now I believe in this product. It is still working after purchase about a year ago. It's cheap, keeps me smelling good and doesn't irritate my skin. It can be difficult to hold on to and slippery, but It is money well spent. I highly recommend it.	Economically priced with long lasting results and truth that a little goes a long way, this crystal rock deodorant is a great deal.  Users are pleased with the crystals ability to eliminate body odor even for heavy perspirers. Recommended for those who want to get away from the traditional stick, though be careful for if dropped it will shatter so also may be best purchased in-store versus ordering online.
health_personal_care	B000EXUB3E	I love these protein bars in the vanilla flavor. They taste like Rice Krispies treats with vanilla frosting. I can't believe they are actually 'good' for you. I usually try to stay away from processed foods, but these are my guilty pleasure -- I eat them for dessert all the time. I like them MUCH better than the chocolate NuGo bars.	Nugo bars are great for breakfast, lunch or a snack. I keep them in my desk at work and my husband keeps them in his car. Eat them with a tall glass of water and they will keep you satisfied for hours. They are low-glycemic and taste great. I'm so glad I can order these from Amazon!	Apart from the obvious nutritional value, the taste was surprisingly better than I anticipated. Normally, if I find soy-based nutritional bars tend to have a chalky or tree-bark-like texture and taste. I dare say, the texture reminds me of a healthy-not-too-sweet 'Rice Krispy Treat'.	I tried these for the first time at work, and loved them. BUT they sell them for $3.80 a bar! And even though they are totally worth it, I wanted to purchase my own box. My kids even got to try them and they really like them too! I will be ordering two boxes next time around!	Love the bar, love the taste, love the 170 calories... LOVE it, my husband and son love it too---we eat way too many of them but I dont feel guilty as it is a great and healthy snack on the go!! This one is my favorite of all!	I find these a little chewy (my jaw gets tired towards the very end), but that could just be me. I love these. I think the flavor is good. They keep me feeling fuller longer than other brands that I've had. My work has them and I loved them so much I ended up coming here to get a whole box.	Very Good! We all eat these and other bars in our house for meal replacements. These are one of their favorites but they are very sweet! In comparison, there are bars that have better ingredients but this one is good! They remind me of rice krispy treats!	I love this flavor of NuGo bars. Not many grocery stores carry it, so when they do I buy all they have on the shelves. When I am out of them I have to order them online. I always keep one or two in my purse for when I am out and hungry and don't care to buy junk food.	These NuGo bars are fantastic and taste great like a Rice Krispy treat. Good for morning, lunch or afternoon snack and a good way to get your protein in-take. They keep you full for a long time especially if you are out and about. I keep one in my purse to eat on the go.	Can be a little pricey at $3.80 per bar, but these NuGo bars offer a low calorie, low glycemic index snack that is healthy and still taste great. Taste is reminiscent of Rice Krispie treats, especially the variety with vanilla frosting. Some stores don't carry these bars, but they are available easily online.	The NuGo bar is very good and tastes better than you would expect and nutrition bar to taste.They have a texture similar to rice krispy treats. There's a good chance your family members will love them too. At only 170 calories you get a delicious snack and something with good nutritional value. They may be a little hard to find if looking in stores but can be ordered form Amazon. Overall, the NuGo bar is a great recommendation.
health_personal_care	B000EZUQK0	The capsules MUST be kept in the original container with the drying agent.If you place them in your own container for later use - you will find a pile of powder and a paper shell. I wouldn't want to guess their shelf-life.And don't expect a notice on the label!	I have only used this for 2 weeks and I have noticed a huge difference in my workouts. Also my veins are popping out!!! I highly recommend this product! Works way better than every other high priced NO product.	Unlike the other user. I think these pills are of good quality. I often take a couple out of the container and pack them with my lunch or for work and have not had a problem with them turning into powder.Great price and good quality.	Some of these tablets blow up for me as well. When i tried to use the the blown up loose tablets... severely burned my tongue... like battery acid! http: / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / B0013OVX3U / ref = cm _ cr _ rev _ prod _ img	Well I cant really say how they work since I got the 500Mg but order the 1000Mg so im taking 2 500 not really filling a diffrents yet I know this take time right about the end of the botle I will see a diffrents	I saw one reviewer post the tablets bust and that is true. The bottle comes with 120 Tablets and I got to use about half of them normally the rest i had to strip the tablet layer and dump into my pre workout. I really like now products but this one was a bust literally. Go with the cheaper Walgreens brand those do not break open.	I bought this for my sister who was having... ummm... shall we say desire problems. Apparently your libido pretty much disappears on some antidepressants. This, according to her, worked like a charm and brought hers back. I would consider buying it for that purpose.	I could deal with the large size of the pill, but when I put them in my weekly pill case, the pills expanded and disintegrated into a powdery heap! I read the label and it didn't say anything about storing in original container. Very upset with this product. Not sure if this supplement even helps.	These pills will do the job, that's if you get to use them long enough to notice they are working. The label on the bottle doesn't state this, however, if you do not keep these pills in the original bottle with the drying agent, they will bust and turn into powder making them unusable.	I think this supplement is great. It is a very good value for the price. I do highly recommend that you store them in the original container, because humidity it definitely not it's friend. I have followed the instructions exactly, and it has done wonders for me. There are many brands that are more expensive, but this brand is just as good, if not better.	The tablets provide a good pump when they actually decide to stay tablets. They tend to seemingly break apart in the container, just leaving powder behind. It is at a great price, at least.
health_personal_care	B000N245Y2	I'd like to give it a review but no power adapter with cord and so on was included. I got a plug adapter for international use, but nothing to power the unit. I have no idea how good it is and am returning it.	Don't let the 1980's packaging fool you, this is an amazing little machine. The sound is robust, and the ability to dial in the mixture of rain and water effects is outstanding.Now... when will they release an App so I can use it on my phone at the office...	We've used Marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this Travel machine didn't make the grade. Sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. This was $50 +. We returned it to Amazon.	This product does not drown out sound but is a sleep conditioner. It was purchased for my grandaughter who is going on a mission trip to Africa (it takes batteries) and to college in NC. It is a perfect traveling size.	This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made.	We have a full-size analog model of the Marpac Sleep Mate sound conditioner, and have used it for years at home, but it's too bulky to pack. This model is compact, and sounds pretty much like the original. There is no repeating 'loop' of sound to drive you crazy.	We've had this for about two months and use it in our baby's nursery. I like it so far. The sound fills the room well. There aren't a bunch of options in sound, but that doesn't matter at all to me. The unit is small and does the job well. I'd recommend it.	My husband and I use a white noise machine in our condo, and love it. When we traveled, we never felt we slept as well without that background noise. We have tried the free Apps on our phones, but they are not as good as this.	a good product, compares to the original very good, for the fraction of the size. very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm, since the space is an issue there. there was no power cord, so that should be kept in mind. much better than nose generating apps.	This sound machine is small, battery powered, and compact.  It does not come with a power adapter, so be prepared with batteries wherever you plan to use it.  There is only one sound programmed into the machine – a sound mixture of rain and water.  This is great to aid sleep, relaxation in the office, or nurseries.	This sound machine is the perfect size for traveling. It is quite compact, and it can be powered with the adapter or batteries. It offers a small variety of rain and other water effects, and will be loud enough for most people. If you have a larger room or a super noisy environment, the volume might not be high enough for you.
health_personal_care	B000YA8NYQ	This is rated the best pill for motion sickness. dramamine pills are really strong and can make you sleepy. you will also hear about ginger. the bad thing about ginger is if you really throw up its no going to be good, i mean tasting the ginger. hope this help everyone.	I have such severe motion sickness, that I can't even SLEEP on a ship! But I was able to enjoy my 5 day / 4 night cruise, as long as I left one of these in my mouth to dissolve. I even slept with one! I highly recommend this product.	I brought this along my 7 night cruise trip - works great even though I tend to forget taking it until I already feel the motion sickness. My cruise happened to meet some heavy showers and I felt no dizziness or sickness except the constant waving feeling:) Definitely will bring it along next time I go to cruise again or plan to ride roller coasters.	This is my favorite type of motion sick medicine. It doesn't make me drowsy and it works well. The chewable tablets don't taste too bad and I'd rather chew a tablet than swallow one whole anyway. Great product!	I've been taking this medicine since I was a little one and it works great! I get motion sickness so easily, but if I take one Bonine, I don't get sick! I can travel for hours in the car, ride all the looping, twisting, crazy rides at the amusement parks and not get sick! It's wonderful.	I stopped riding on roller coasters and other rides at most amusement parks until I started taking the BONINE tablets. Works well for me and I take it in the morning about an hour before going on any ride and I have been able to enjoy the rides with my kids!! No more nausea and headache!!!	Product worked the very way it was intended. We were on a cruise that had high seas and because we were unable to use the patches that go behind the ear, we used this as an alternative. It worked great, no problems.	Husband and I went on week long live-aboard scuba trip. I could not have had a good time without these. THANK GOD.. it was a wonderful trip, and I did not get sea-sick at all, in a full week never leaving the small yacht we dove from. Recommend!	Bonine tablets are an excellent choice for preventing motion sickness. They effectively prevent motion sickness from cars, boats, and amusement park rides. A bonus: the chewable tablets do not cause drowsiness.	This medicine works really well on cruises and for roller-coaster rides. You could take a week long trip on a boat and still not get sick. The tablets are chewable or can dissolve in the mouth,  and unlike Dramamine they don't cause drowsiness.	Bonine helps with motion sickness from roller coasters, water, and car travel. They do not make me sleepy. The chewable tablet is easy to take and it does not taste bad. I was able to enjoy a cruise recently because I had these tablets. They worked as advertised and helped me a lot with my motion sickness.
health_personal_care	B002BJU8YQ	I was unsure of replacing this battery from a backup power supply from Goodwill. But the price was right, the battery can in good condition, and worked as advertised. I'd say I'm totally happy with this item and will recommend it to anyone else looking for this type.	Was not the brand as advertised. Was Genesis and not Yuasa (perhaps the same manufacturer). Lasted for 2 years in my APC UPS. The plastic case is now bulging. I just ordered another Yuasa from a different company. Let's see what arrives.	We ordered this battery to replace the one that went bad in our home alarm system. It was a perfect match, works well, and arrived BEFORE the expected delivery date. The price was also a great deal! I would definitely buy from this seller again.	It seems that many of the buyers out there reports defective Dead On Arrival battery from various replacement purchases. This is the case with mine, as it does not hold a charge.Its going to cost me about the same just to return it to the seller.Wish there was better quality control	Simple to install as a direct drop-in replacement for the existing / failing battery. Wish there was a return for the dead cell to allow for proper recycling, but I found a local store that would take the dead one and do the right thing with it...	This battery is of good quality and holds a charge quite well. Alarm companies charge an arm and a leg for a battery that costs them only this much and are of similar specs. Save yourself a bunch of money and do this replacement yourself.This name brand is a name that we are all familiar with and can trust	Great value for a quality battery. Fast shipper and superb customer service. Purchased for a gate opener. Have had for only 3 weeks but so far, have met my needs and expectations. Would definitely recommend and purchase from this vendor again.	Works great. Great price. Bought it to replace the dead battery on my ups for my computer. The size appears to be a common size because it fit perfectly. Now I wish I swapped batteries on my old ups instead of filling up the land fill.Good product. Go for it.	This battery is a good replacement for old or failing batteries in a home alarm system or computer. The battery works well and is a really good value for the money, compared with other brands with similar specs. I was especially pleased with the fast shipping from the seller.	Save yourself the money and use this battery to replace your alarm system battery yourself. Calling the home alarm system company to replace the battery costs way mire than just doing this yourself. This battery holds a fantastic charge and replacement is not difficult at all.	This is a good battery that is easy to install and works as a replacement for failed batteries. The price is good and a much cheaper alternative to use as a replacement. While there are instances of DOA batteries, most experiences are positive. With a good price and easy installation this battery is recommended.
health_personal_care	B0039PH51K	Always consult with your doctor before purchasing any circulation product after surgery. I had ankle surgery and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot. This increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot (only after doc said wait bearing was okay). I use it sitting down barefoot.	I really like the Acupressure Mat. I usually toss and turn a lot when I sleep, now I use this before I go to bed and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.	I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since. After 2 ten minute sessions, I am sold. I have slept much better at night - I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep. A rather inexpensive option to relieving tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders.	This is the best thing! you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it. I use it every morning to walk across to jump start my body. when I think about it I will lay on it, it feels wonderful.	I love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache. its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work. Helps with pain in my back and pain in my legs. Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.	I wish I hadn't purchased this item. I just can't get use to it, it's not comfortable. I have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because I don't relax or use it for long enough.	I run an alternative health center and use Acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S & H was outstanding and really fast.	I ordered this acupressure mat to see if it would help relieve my back pain and at first it seemed like it wasn't doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief and it also helps you relax. I use it almost everyday now and it really helps. I recommed this product and this seller.	The Acupressure mat is great for helping to relax. It takes a little bit of time to try it but once it works it works well. The mat helps with pain and pressure and is great to lay on, it is great for falling asleep on. Also it is great for blood circulation and for walking on bare feet.	These acupressure mats are used to increase circulation and reduce body aches and pains and are most effective when you can fully relax. Consistence is key to receive the full, relaxing benefits of the product.  However, if you are using this product after surgery it is responsible to always consult with your physician to ensure it is right for your situation.	This acupressure mat can help ease aches and tension, increase blood circulation to extremities, and aid in general relaxation and restfulness. It can also assist in healing, as it reduces movement while sleeping. However, it takes some getting used to, and being unable to relax while using it will make it ineffective.
health_personal_care	B003HT9W32	I bought this monitor as a newcomer to heart rate monitors. It is easy to use right out of the box and makes working out more enjoyable - you can make sure that you are working hard enough to improve, but not too hard. Very good value.	It's my first heart rate monitor. Very useful. I always run with it to control my pace. The problem is when I run more then 1 hour because I don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display.	Extremely easy to use, only one button. Seems to be fairly accurate. Has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. However, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily.	I was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. But after checking the manual on the internet I was able to set it up and use it. It is much easier than others I have purchased. This is what I was looking for. Ease of use.	This is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. Beginner or non-competitive runners should stick to basic types like this. The Polar monitors I have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. I am coming off a long layoff and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking overtraining.	If you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. There aren't any bells and whistles at all. Straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. The log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session.	This was very well-rated on consumer reports. I really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. The display is easy to read and it's light-weight.	I ordered and Polar FT2 and it was confirmed after the order was processed. When I got the email for confirmation, it said FT1. They did the old bait and switch on me! I immediately returned it and very upset with the order after going through a long process of doing research for a HRM. Very dissatisfied!	very good heart monitor if you don't need advanced features, that would be used mainly by professionals.  very easy use. the drawbacks are, bad or no included manual, but manual is accessible on the internet. and only four digits on the display, so if you run more than an hour that could be an issue. overall recommended	This heart rate monitor is very user friendly for beginners.  Very easy to use straight out of the box. However, this product comes with an instruction booklet and internet instructions if you need help with initial set up. You can program your target heart rate and there is an audible beep when you are in or fall out of target range. Very easy to read display which can also has a backlight. The only drawback is the log will only store the last workout data.  Overall a very nice beginner heart rate monitor.	This is a good monitor, it is easy to use and well-made. The product is for you, if you are in need of a heart rate monitor. It is fairly accurate and warns you should in case you fall out of a target heart range. The battery is not replaceable and screen easily scratches.
health_personal_care	B004OQQLTU	Regretfully the package arrived in a plastic bag with a note on it telling us that the Post Office cares. The bottle had been completely crushed in bag it was sent in, so we never got to use it.The bag of liquid did smell great though!!!	I tried this on both a cotton t-shirt, and a polyester dress shirt, and it worked quite well, and very quick; almost effortless. Just spray it on, and smooth it with your fingers.The product says it can be used in the place of starch, but my wife tried it when ironing, and it didn't help at all.	i WOULD NOT RISK BUYING THIS ITEM. WAS DELIVERED TODAY. THE PACKAGE WAS COMPLETELY SOAKED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN ANY SPRAY BOTTLE. I WILL BE ASKING FOR FULL REFUND.Amazon gave me a full credit when I chatted with them. I can't review since I didn't get any to try.	I really do not like to iron. I still have a scar from my last attempt. I love this product. I just spray onto my cotton shirt and smooth, then allow to dry about 30-60 minutes. There is an obvious reduction in wrinkles. No, it is not perfect, but it is presentable.	My wife and I tried this on a few items but it didn't work that great. I still have a lot of the bottle left so I'll keep on trying, but if we want it done right we still turn to the iron first. I do, however, really like how it takes away the static electricity buildup.	I love this stuff. It works on every types of clothing from jeans to tshirts and dress shirts. Spray a little on an work the wrinkle out with your hand! Just don't overspray. We take this on vacation so we don't have to waster our time ironing!	Woohoo what a great product. A few sprays and the wrinkles disappear from your teeshirts and dress shirts. It has a little trouble with clothing like dress pants and also it didn't work on removing wrinkles from my curtains. That said, this baby has saved me hours of ironing, and I'm super happy with this purchase.	This is a wonderful wrinkle release product. Just spray it on your fabric, any fabric smooth the product in with hands smoothing out wrinkles and let dry. Goodbye iron. I will definitely take it on my next vacation. It removes wrinkles and makes clothes smell fresh, I love it.	While it's not full proof, this spray is great at reducing the number of wrinkles in cotton and polyester materials. It's less effective on thicker materials. It's quick and easy to use, and it has a nice scent. It's a good thing to bring on vacation to freshen up packed clothes. Just be aware, the bottle is prone to leaking!	This is an awesome wrinkle release product, with a nice aroma. When applied, wrinkles disappear from your clothes. The package arrived in a bad condition, it's not perfect, but quite presentable. I love it.	When my bottle arrived, it had leaked a bit in the bag, but I still had about 3/4 to use. It smells amazing! I have always really hated ironing, so it's a good substitute for that, but only on my shirts. Any work pants that have wrinkles, I still have to turn on the iron. However, it really seems to reduce static when ironing, so it's still handy that way! Overall it's not as great as advertised, but it's still pretty useful. Order with caution though, leakage seems to be a common occurrence.
health_personal_care	B004U3Y9FU	These are a good value, but they're NOT burp-less. They tend to make me burp for up to an hour or two after taking them. I don't like fish, so I was terrified of fish burps, but they're actually not terrible and don't taste very 'fishy.'	Well, I've taken the first softgel capsule and given it enough time now and I can say it is, indeed, truly burp-less, unlike certain other fish oil products I've tried that shall remain nameless. If I pass away due to coronary disease, I'll consider lowering my rating of it but I'll still have appreciated its burp-lessness.	i've tried the nature made original Fish Oil before and i didn't like the fishy smell and sometimes bad burp after taste... But this Burp-less version is really better as i haven't burped and it has no fishy smell... I'm switching to this one permanently..	My husband takes 4 per day - I take 2. The price on Subcribe & Save is good. The product is consistant high quality, delivered same time each month and I don't have to go to the store to find the shelf empty. Product is worth the purchase. I know I will get the same product every month and its a good product	I couldn't handle the burping up of fish smell that other fish oil gels came with. And preferred not to use the liquid version. This gel is great. I been using it for months now--and not one burp!:)	If you are like me I like sushi but I couldnt stand the constant taste of it when I was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why I stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and I did but it didnt matter. I love this fish oil it does what it says..	I have been using Nature Made products for years. I feel Amazon offers them at a great price. These Fish Oil caps are the burp less variety which I would recommend to others if you take Fish Oil daily as I do. I would order them again. Also received them within a few days.	For anyone like myself who uses Omega 3 Fish oil on a regular basis, I recommend this product. This is the burp-less version which leaves no after taste in your mouth and is easily swallowed with a small amount of liquid. Stay heart healthy and take Omega 3 daily.	These soft gel capsule are not like ordinary Fish Oil capsules. If you do not like the fish oil smell in your burps these soft gels are perfect fit. This is burp-less version and will not bother your breathing with any smell or any burps. The price is definitely worth the quality of the product.	Using the Omega 3 Fish oil tablets will  give you a great blueprint for better health. Imagine not having to take the medicine and then burping afterwards, this burp- less version does this.   I have it on auto ship and love not ever missing a dose or having to look for it in the stores.	I found this fish oil very good, and i don't like fish. the burps are present but less than other fish oil products. soft gel structure doesn't leave fishy aftertaste. I am pleased with the product.
health_personal_care	B005H86LZ8	What else can be said..... this product is revolutionary. I cannot believe something so simple could be so effective and I wonder why I didn't see this myself! Kudos to the inventor. This magnet is strong and putting your glasses through the space while working is easy and just as easy to retrieve them when needed. Necessity is the mother of invention....	I saw this product on SHARK TANK and wanted it then. When I ordered it and tried it I was very impressed. The magnet is super strong and you can place it anywhere on your clothing. I bought 2 and will order more for Christmas gifts.Ellen	I wish I could use this, but my cardilogist said no.... even though I have a fairly new, high-fangled pacemaker. He doesn't have any problem with me having a cell phone in my shirt pocket, but said this magnet is just too powerful.	These little guys are amazing,, the magnetic is very strong,, your glasses will not fall out when bending over.. yeah maybe a crystal does fall out so what,, just glue it back in and it stays,, you'll always know where your glasses are,, love mine	I like it, keeps the glasses handy but when you bend over, they can fall out. So good idea, but has its limits. Perhaps if it didn't stick out as far, that would hold the glasses tighter.	ReadeRest Eye-Glass Holder-Magnet broke off after one week and I have no phone number to call the company. For the week I had it, it worked fine on my shirt but one of the front round magnets separted from the glass holding piece. A piece of junk!	Fantastic product! Ive had to order more now that ive shown to everyone. They all want one. Can be placed anywhere on your clothing and blends right in. Had people think it was part of the clothing. great gift / stocking stuffer	Great Product! Very Strong Magnet that works in holding and keeping your glasses secure. Well worth the price that I paid for it... First showing of this product was on 'Shark Tank' and it has lived up to expectations!	This product is innovative and works! It keeps your glasses with you and the strong magnet lasts. Everyone that I've shown this to decides that they need one too. The only problems are that the small pieces can occasionally fall off, and the glasses don't always stay if you bend over. Otherwise, this is a great product that is especially useful if you tend to misplace your glasses.	This lived up to expectations after the product was featured on Shark Tank. The magnet is very strong, and will work anywhere on clothing. Glasses won't slip or fall. However, those with pacemakers should avoid due to the strong magnet. Overall, recommend.	These magnetic eyeware retainers attach firmly to your clothes and keep your glasses within reach when you're not wearing them. Though they normally keep a strong grip, it is possible in some circumstances for your glasses to fall out. Also, I am unsure if the product will last very long.
health_personal_care	B005JS7KME	Got these for my 9-year-old who has really bad foot odor. I really had little confidence that these would work but needed to try something- ANYTHING- to help. And lo and behold they actually work. So well that I ordered another set for a second pair of shoes.	I love this product... 100% natural AND eliminates foot odor! While it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. Very impressed! It has worked wonders so far! Can't wait to put this product to test this summer!	I have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. I had tried everything to get rid of it. The final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. FINALLY, normal soft feet!	The insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. I love that they are discreet and thin. I no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. I definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles.	Product is OK. It doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. It does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. I wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost less.Ok	Im sure if I were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. I am wearing them in my croc I have to wear for work. Thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around.	This is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! They are so effective I use them in several pairs of shoes. I'm a very happy customer, thanks so much Zederna!	These insoles are so thin that I can even wear them in my pumps. They look SO much nicer than odor-eaters and work way better too. I highly recommend them. I accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. It was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. Enjoy!	This is an excellent product! Just as advertised, it eliminates foot odor and on top of that the insole is so thin it can be used in multiple types of shoes including heels. Very comfortable and well worth the price to have soft odor free feet after wearing shoes!	While they are a little thin which can be an issue, the Insoles work really well at keeping odor away and fits really well in most shoes. While cheaper ones do exist on the market, these ones have been great at battling the issues i had before using these insoles.	These odor-absorbing insoles work very well! The thin insoles fit well into many kinds of footwear and they are also easy to trim down if they are too large. They help to absorb odor and wetness all day. , and may even extend the life of my shoes.
health_personal_care	B006ZO110I	I've been using this for about two years and refilled twice. The only thing is I didn't pay attention that this one has a wand which I don't need since I have one and it is still in very good shape. I was looking for just refills. But in any way it's easy to use and works well for us.	I love these cleaners. They are easy to use and do a great job. Some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but I think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets.	I love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? Chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! What a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	These are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). I use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) Good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean.	These are great buys. They are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, I always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money.	I have been using these for a long time, what I like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. Clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job.	i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable.	Who wants to stick their hand in a toilet? Not I! I love the wand and the refills are wonderful. NO touching required, and they scrub very well! My toilet bowl is gleaming after using these!! I'll never use anything else.	I love these cleaners, it does a great job and it's easy to use. I like that they are disposable. They scrub very well, no touching required and the refills are wonderful. It is well worth the money.	I love using these for cleaning my toilet they are easy to use, work really well and very good for scrubbing. Once used up you can dispose off it easily, does the job very well, good buy.	amazing product, single use toilet cleaners do a great job. they keep toilet sanitary and cleaning process is mess free. a lot better than reusable brushes. But the might be discontinued, so stock up while you still can. would not want to use anything else after i tried this product.
health_personal_care	B008Z8W714	I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I am pleasantly pleased. The unit fits perfectly into my Zippo case, and is easy to fill and use. Once in a while it won't light but if you blow into the flame area it will work the next try.	I think Zippo over charges and I wanted to try off brand. I must say I have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me. Don't get me wrong I love classic Zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for EDC since they have almost zero odor. The torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference.	got for a christmas gift and i cant say how awsome this insert is i love that the fuel wont just evaporate the flames a bit big at first and had to urn screw as how the little lever wouldnt go over far enough but again no biggy awsome product i challenge you to blow this thing out	i bought this product expecting it to last about a week, that was almost a year ago. i want to share just the facts: it plastic so don't go beating it aroundits a little small so some tape is needed to build it up and hold it in placeif you clean it right it will last for a long time	I like carrying my classic Zippo and not tainting my cigars with lighter fluid. Much cheaper to get a Zippo and this insert than to buy a Zippo Blu. I also prefer the electric ignition to the flint wheel on the Zippo Blu.	I love the old style Zippo but was having difficulty with the standard fluid and carrying the lighter around in my pocket. This made it very convenient and it's a cool 'novelty' item. I still keep most of my Zippos original (standard insert), but it's cool to have a few of these with the 'butane' conversion kit...	It did not fit properly. I then removed it and re-inserted original Zippo insert. To my dismay, cap of Zippo no longer closed properly. (Apparently, attempting to get the Thunderbird insert into the Zippo and close the cap caused the hinge to deform, rendering the Zippo unusable). Disappointing, to say the least!	Thank God I found this. It works on Butane, and it will hold fuel longer than a week. Stupid Zippo, with their flints, and their packing, and their wicks. They make a version of this with a flint, do not buy that one, buy this one. It works great. Stay away form Z-plus.	Great insert for the price, works well with my Zippo case. It uses butane, which is cleaner burning as well as convenient. Thunderbird is a fantastic alternative to the more pricey Zippo inserts. It holds a big flame, too, and it's easily adjustable.	This butane conversion allows for the case of a classic Zippo to clean burning butane lighter.  It allows for flame height adjustments and holds its flame well.  It is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use. While this is not a licensed Zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed.	When I ordered this, I didn't know what to expect. I'm pleasantly surprised. It's plastic, but very convenient and the unit fits very well into my Zippo case. You can fine tune your preference as the torch adjusts very nicely. It works great. I also had issues with closing the cap of Zippo.
health_personal_care	B00GW5NX88	Immediately curbed my RLS. Feels great to get some sleep! Also has produced a noticeable improvement in my girlfriends mood over the last week. Cant recommend this stuff enough. Many people are deficient in Magnesium these days which can cause a whole host of problems. This pure product is definetly the most affordable and effective way to supplement magnesium daily.	It is a very good dissolving powder, i noticed that I feel much more calm and rested since using a teaspoon a day for the last 2 days... I cant give it 5 stars because of the short time Ive been taking it, but I will update this review in about a week.	I use this in conjunction with N-Acetyl L-Cysteine and TUDCA for the liver, but it has been GREAT for my arthritis! I definitely will continue to use this product. I currently take 3327 mg x d, so it is reasonably priced. Again, great product!	I purchased this to put in my Soylent mix, and I couldn't be happier. Like other supplements I've ordered from this company, the product is well shipped and the resealable bag is easy to store. I also like how concentrated it is, and how little I need to use to supplement my diet.Couldn't be happier.	I have been taking Magnesium supplements for a number of years. Magnesium Citrate seems to work best for me, and I like being able to customize my own dosage. No fillers, and no artificial flavoring, excellent packaging, and a quality product.	I am not pleased with this product. I ordered this because it was the same ingredient in a similar product, 'CALM' magnesium citrate powder. However, this product is not what I expected. It does not taste or fizz like the CALM powder. This was an attempt to order in bulk and save money, but I failed with this one.	I like this product, but not sure how it's as strong as it says it is. I have noticed that I have better results from the Calms magnesium than taking double the dose of this product. I don't get the upset stomach from this like what's common for a citrate form, so maybe it's being absorbed better.	The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder dissolves easily in liquid and works especially great in my natural smoothies that I mix in a blender, and can also work great with juices. A much better deal than magnesium citrate in liquid solution form, especially the 1Kg bag.	this magnesium supplement is very good for the money. helps to improve the mood, to make sleep better. the price is a better deal than the competitor products. especially if you buy in bulk. one thing, it does not taste like a CALM product, so you should keep that in mind. recommended.	This product has been helpful for my everyday aches and pains. I found that I can easily mix it into my morning smoothies, juice or even plain almond milk without any weird taste or fizzing. The product came very well packaged and I love the resealable bag for easy storage.All in all a great product.	The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder is a unique product in its own right. as it does dissolve well, it has a lot of health benefits such as calming down , arthritis. as it comes in a liuid form i prefer the powder for some weird reason. With it being so affordable, ordering this in a large amount is preferred for me and lastly with it being so  concentrated it can last for a long time
home_kitchen	B00006IUVM	I had an almost identical steamer from Black & Decker purchased around 1985. The lid on that one finally broke and I've been looking for one like it for 2 years. Nice to see a good design hasn't been changed. Love the steamer!	I bought this one as a replacement for an old one I had. We cook with it every day and love it! It is the perfect size for our family. Although the picture shows it with a clear lid, the one I received in the mail had a white lid.	I love this steamer. Everyone in my family now has one because they are so great. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up boiled-over rice from the stove! It also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free.	THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THESE STEAMERS. I USED THE FIRST ONE ALMOST DAILY FOR OVER 5 YEARS. I LOVE THE VERSITILITY OF THIS ITEM. MAKES EXCELLENT STEAMED SHRIMP, THE RICE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, VEGETABLES TASTE GREAT. JUST A USEFUL ITEM TO HAVE IN THE KITCHEN.	I love this steamer. I use it to steam all kinds of vegetables and new potatoes. I really like the larger basket and the screen where you can put herbs or spices to flavor what you are cooking. I highly recommend it.	Sometimes I use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when I want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. I've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. The instruction book in helpful too. Thank you.	boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) I would definately recommend this product. The only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have NO couter space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it.	This is our second B / D steamer. The first served us well for years before the plexiglass bowl cracked and finally broke. It was impossible to find a replacement in any major chain stores. Lots of rice steamers but no small in size vegetable steamers. Amazon came through again. Thanks Jeff!	This kitchen steamer is based on a classic design, works very well and is convenient to use. It can steam a variety of foods, from vegetables and starches, to seafood and eggs. It's rather large, which can be an issue if your counter space is limited. Overall, highly recommended.	This steamer is an excellent product. It does wonderful when cooking rice, boiling eggs, steaming vegetables and more! It makes clean up a breeze and even has a handy screen for putting seasoning in what your cooking. Definitley a nice addition to any kitchen!	This is a very nice and roomy steamer.  It has plenty of space to steam multiple items or even just one.  It is on the larger side so it is hard to store when not in use.  All the food that is steamed in it comes out perfect and clean up is easy.  i would recommend this to anyone.
home_kitchen	B0000CCY1S	I bought the Kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the OXO brand. Would not buy this brand again. When slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't contentiously keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing.	I am not excited about this peeler and wish I had found an easier tool. I have julienned my fingers using it - very sharp just like their other peelers which I have and love. It is difficult to use on carrots without injuring my fingers, maybe I just can't get the hang of it!	This is my 3rd purchase of julienne peelers the 1st 2 didn't work \u2026 waste of money. This one is the best ever! I have been making zucchini noodles and so many other things! Try this recipe I made! [...]	This julienne peeler works fantastic! I like the shield, I had to be very careful with my other on in the drawer to not get cut reaching for something. It is so much easier to handle with this grip and the blade stays in place. I would buy this product again.	This little guy performs really well and is comfortable to handle for long periods. The blade guard is a little weird in how it pivots, so it's kind of difficult to clean. My guard actually broke off, so I just left it off. The blades on this thing are quite sharp! So be careful if the same happens to you.	The Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great gadget. I use it to Julienne zucchini and eggplant. Zucchini Julienned and sauteed quickly with EVOO, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper is a terrific side dish. Even people who do not like zucchini will eat this.	It's easy to use and clean. It's a good price and does exactly what I wanted. I bought it to make julienne veggies carrots, zucchini noodles. It makes shorter pieces than a big fancy spiralizer, but that's good for me.	Strong and it works. I made zucchini noodles with this handy little device and now it looks like I'll be making this more often.Julienne the noodles and lightly salt them while the noodles are drying, make whatever sauce you are going to pour over them. The heat from the sauce should cook the noodles to a perfect al dente.	This is a nice little julienne peeler, it does a fantastic job when making zucchini noodles or slicing carrots. It is not as effective for fruit, which gets stuck and makes it hard to keep slicing. It's VERY sharp, watch your fingers! Overall, this Oxo has a comfortable grip and is a great deal.	The Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is very handy, comfortable, and works great. It's a fair price and cuts well. But it's very sharp, so be careful when handling it. You may have to stop slicing occasionally to clear out the blade if the veggies get stuck, but overall, it's very easy to use and to clean.	while there are some products that may be cheaper and seem like they might work better short term, but the Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great tool in the kitchen as is durable for the long haul.. while it is extremely sharp, the shield provide excellent safety and support for your hand. All in all this is an excellent assistance to using a knife. Buy this soon
home_kitchen	B0002U34HY	We've used these filters in our DustBuster for several years. With a little care, such as occasionally blowing it out with air or tapping on sidewalk, they have very long life. Seem to catch everything from grit, to dog hair, to fine ashes without letting much blow through exhaust. Getting harder to find at local stores, so I bought two.	This is the wrong filter if you are buying the CHV1510 Hand Vacuum. Amazon pairs it up together and it SAYS it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs,' but it doesn't. You need the VF110 for the CHV1510. Amazon WRONG. Product Description WRONG. Me wrong for not reading the reviews first.	Instead of having to buy an all new Dustbuster just because mine is older and the filters aren't in stock anywhere didn't mean I had to updrage & pay for a newer one. After having found the filters here, I buy them and they work extremely well. Very satisfied.	I bought this to replace my tired and dirty filter. After I received it, I realized that there was nothing wrong with the one I already had. (They are washable.) However it helps to have two, so you can change the filter quickly when necessary and not take time to wash the first one.	This item list listed with the vacuum -- 'frequently bought together' with the Black & Decker CHV9608 9.6 Volt Cyclonic-Action Cordless DustBuster BUT this filter does NOT fit! Argh! Corrections are needed in the 'frequently bought together' section, and the correct filter needs to be listed.	I bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum I got. Recently, I went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. To boot, I missed the window to get a refund. Rip off!	I bought the cordless Cyclonic DustBuster CHV1408. The correct filter for the DustBuster CHV1408 is Replacement Filter VF08. In the 'Frequently Bought Together' section at Amazon, both the VF100 replacement filter and the VF08 replacement filter are listed. The VF100 replacement filter WILL NOT fit the CHV1408.	I was disappointed to discover that the filter does not fit the Black and Decker Dustbuster I own. There are nubs around the top that prevent it from working. I have not been able by number or description to locate the proper filter or Amazon or anywhere else. This is very disappointing as I purchased the vacuum on Amazon.	Buying a new dustbuster is unnecessary when in reality just cleaning or replacing the filters will do the job just fine. Amazon also provides added risk by recommending dustbusters that don't fit with certain filters.	I bought these because I know that these filters are the ones I need. I've bought them before, but Amazon repeatedly tells me that I need a different filter. I think their Bought Together section is messed up, so don't buy this filter just because Amazon says to. Anyways, these filters have always worked well for me.	"Before purchasing this product, I highly suggest checking your vaccumn to see what type of filters will fit. Amazon lists this product with several cyclone vaccumns under the ""commonly purchased together"" section and that is not correct. This filter wilk not work in just any cyclone vaccumn. If this fliter actually fits in your vaccumn, its a great product and will last a long time if you take care of it and rinse it off occassionally."
home_kitchen	B000COQT0Y	I spent an hour looking for a solar system poster that included Pluto. My son insists it is unfair that Pluto was 'fired'. It includes information on conditions, atmosphere, diameter, and the duration of each planets 'day' and 'year'. It covered all the basic information we needed, and it is beautiful.	Pretty happy with the poster for something to teach my son when he grows up about just how small our world actually is compared to the other planets that are out there.Overall good quality and looks pretty good up on the wall.Big enough to catch someones eye and clear enough to tell which planet is which.	This poster is a few years out of date - still lists Pluto as a planet - but man, the artwork on it is awesome. I also love the inset map that shows the planets' sizes to scale. It's probably not good for a classroom due to its age, but for a bedroom or general decoration, it's great.	My son said 'Wow, this is great!' He's only 4 years but he's enjoying learning about the solar system. Each planet has an informative summary. Great service! Will be framing the poster for his room. Love it!!	Its a great poster! Bought at a huge discount. Only thing is I thought the description said laminated. It was not, its a standard poster. But its perfect for what I needed it for. Now I just have to get a frame for it: D	I could not have been more disappointed in my purchase! The picture and size was perfect but there were so many wrinkles it looked terrible. I took it to a professional framer and even using there equipment the wrinkles remained. When I bought the poster it was supposed to be brand new. I was really ripped off and may never order from Amazon again.	It's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. The poster is nice though. We didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot!	The item arrived on time and my son loves it. It's posted on the side wall next to his bed. He looks at it all the time. The picture quality is not perfect but for the price it's okay.	The picture size is perfect, and the quality is great. It's a wonderful tool for teaching a child about the solar system. There is an educational summary for every planet. However, it is slightly dated since Pluto is still included, but you can just tell your child Pluto retired from its position as a planet. It's also not laminated, but we put it in a frame and it looks really nice on the wall.	This poster is great for teaching children about the solar system. It is informative and easy to understand. It does not come with a frame. The quality is not the best and may be difficult to read from far away. Overall, I recommend the poster despite the quality because the price is very low.	The poster is a little outdated because it still lists Pluto as a planet, but it is a beautiful poster. There are some concerns regarding the quality of the shipping as there was the issue of it not being laminated and also having wrinkles.
home_kitchen	B000N6MI7E	These magnets are definitely not strong enough to be worthwhile, even for light objects. Try the ones rated for 25 lbs... even though that's probably overkill for your needs, at least you'll KNOW that they're adequate for any task.	These compact magnets sound too good to be true and do actually look nice in-person, but they don't hold the weight. I wanted to hang hot mits on my fridge, but it took some finagling to get it to stay and I could only put one mit per hook.	I purchased these hooks specifically for the purpose of hanging potholders on the magnetic fridge. They work but you have to gently hang them to prevent the hooks from sliding down. They may, however, work better on other magnetized surfaces. They are tiny and cute but I would not recommend using them as refrigerator magnets.	I purchased the set some years ago and loved how strong the magnets used on the hooks were. I ordered more last week and discovered that the magnets are now 1 / 4 the size on the previous version. The magnets are not at all as strong, and I am very disappointed.	The actual magnets are + / - 1 / 4 'in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things. Did not work for my 6 keys plus a car fob.The hooks look good though. That said, I am sending them back.	for the size of the hanger, it has a very low magnet.doesn't hold too much - not even a small kithen towel. might hold a small keychain... had to cannibalize 3 out of the 5 to make 2 hold some weight.	The magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal surface.Unfortunately, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame. My frame is an 8x11 docuement with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards.	These are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys. They have a diameter of about 3 / 4 of an inch. I wanted to put aprons on them, but they are not big enough, nor strong enough. They have a micro sized magnet on the back that is strong for its tiny appearance.	These hooks look good but looking good is about all they are good for. The magnets on these are tiny (about 1/4 of an inch) and they do not hold much of anything. If you are lucky they might hold a key chain but only if it has one or two keys on it and you have to hang it on the hook gently. These hooks can hardly even hold a pot holder. Definitely would not recommend this product if you are actually trying to hang something on them.	These hooks are decent for hanging up very small things. Common household essentials such as oven mittens or kitchen towels are possible to hang up, but give a hassle with the hook sliding down. The magnets attach to the hooks are too small to handle many things, but are pretty strong for it's size.	These magnets are not strong enough to hold the kids of things I might use a magnetic hook to hold, such as keys, oven mitts, or picture frames. I had to use several at a time to hold up even light objects. Otherwise, the objects tend to slide down the fridge.
home_kitchen	B001EQJ5AU	It was easy to put together and looks great. However, when the item was shipped to me, one of the backs of the chairs was broken. I just fixed it myself with wood glue. Its not even visible now. The rest of it was in perfect condition.	The table and chairs are very nice but not quite the color I expected (but I am getting used to it). Table and chairs delivered by the carrier right on time and with no damage. Very easy to assemble, but very difficult to get out of the box it was so well protected.	This table was super easy to put together. The table and chairs are solid and sturdy! The seats are very comfortable. The table is the perfect size for our not so big kitchen. We are very pleased with this purchase.	Moved to smaller living quarters and this just fits the bill. Color is perfect and it was easy to assemble. One fault to find is that the top scratches easily. It even came with a scratch. Other than that it is fine.	I love my new dining room set. The set is very sturdy, the walnut finish is a nice color.This set is great for a small area, kitchen nook.Would not recommend for a large eating area.Table is small and so are the chairs.Yet strong enough to hold big boys and girls, thumps up, great price, packed well, arrived in a timely matter.	It fits perfectly in the kitchen at the office. My staff assembled it without any delay. Everyone loves the dining set and they can't believe I ordered it on-line. I made the measurements and made sure of the dimensions of the room and the dining set and it's a perfect fit.	I received this table and chairs completely damaged. The customer service experience with this company was terrible. In my opinion, this set is cheap and overpriced. It's not durable and not worth the money. Don't waste your time.	The box looked like it had been opened, and then re-taped for resell. One of the chairs was broken, and the broken piece was nowhere close to the originating piece. Possibly other pieces damaged too, though didn't bother looking, instead just re-taped it back up to be sent back. I hope they don't just resell it to someone else.	Good deal on these tables and chairs! May come in separate packages but they will be well protected. Color may vary from what you see on the website so be aware. Easy assembly. Seems durable enough. Great option for a small living space.	The dinning room set is very sturdy, seats are very comfortable and has a nice color. Great for small area, but I will not advice usage for a large eating area. It looks great and it is easy to put together. The top scratches easily. It was delivered on time and I'm pleased with the purchase.	the product is very easy to assemble. the size and colors are nice, fit in a small room. the major drawback of the product is that it often comes damaged, probably when shipping. Scratches, broken parts, even completely unusable sets are common.
home_kitchen	B001GCV0FK	This teapot works well for me, sometimes I wish it had a whistle. The color appears as shown. Remember to use it on low / medium heat. At first the top is a little difficult to remove but now it works well.	As a tea pot it works fine but the handle is plastic & the cover has repainted & chipped paint at the base of the knob.I am not happy with the product but because of my health & price, I did not send it back.	It's lovely. NO cracking or loss of enamel. It is just the right color. Sadly it is a little smaller than I expected (smaller than the average tea kettle) makes for small batches of tea. Quite happy with it though.	Be warned - the color of this cute little kettle as depicted in this ad is not at all what arrives when you order it. It's more of a medium, dusty sky blue. Not in any way 'turquoise.'	The color is great. Just what I wanted for my kitchen Devore. One thing, I rated 4 stars because I find it difficult to open the lid... it's really tough. It's tight. After a few day it has gotten better. I think it'll keep getting easier. Besides that one flaw I like it.	The kettle is beautiful, but within 5 uses the handle started melting. Apparently the handle is plastic and cannot withstand hot temperatures, which is unfortunate for a product that must hold boiling water. You can buy this kettle if you don't plan on using it. You've been warned!!	Perfect for our seafront condo in Florida style - bought all our kitchen accessories to go with it.No problems, but I do intend to drain all the water out after using and not let any sit overnight in the pot to prevent rust.	I ordered this as a gift because the color is shown as a light turquoise, which I wanted. The color is actually a very dark turquoise, could have bought the same color in Target for less money... the teapot itself is very nice.. may be sending it back though	This is a beautiful kettle even though it appears smaller and the color is a little off from the ads and it may seem a bit smaller  but otherwise it looks very nice. Something to keep in mind of though is the handle seems unable to handle too much heat as it is can melt easier than you'd think.	The color is great. It works fine as a teapot, but the handle is plastic, so it can't withstand high temperatures. I had difficulty removing the lid, but got better after some days. I'm quite happy with it though.	This teapot is cheaply made with a plastic handle, it's not true to color (dark blue instead of turquoise). The lid is really tight, adding to the frustration. Save yourself a return and look elsewhere for a better product.
home_kitchen	B0025OO8DO	Nice quality for the case. Little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. Convenient shape for my purposes. Works as well as any other brands I've had. Case looks durable.I use these for protecting very expensive microphones I keep in sealed Tupperware style cases.	I put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'Soggy. I had to recharge it by baking it. The only this I would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water.	I'm really not sure how good this is going to work. According to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. When I got mine the indicator was already mostly green.	Even though the humidity in the areas I used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. I bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. Way too much energy. I'll probably need a stationary dehumidier.	Love this little unit. Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry.	This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack.	My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. He likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it.	Our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.	It did not work properly, the photocopy machine jams often. But the case looks durable and the unit is quite small to fit in any container of my choosing. It is also rechargeable by using an oven to dry it out.	Easy, convenient way to prevent humidity and moisture in small areas and containers such as safes, cabinets, jewelry boxes, and more. Features a color indicator to notify you when the pack has reached capacity. Easy to recharge by placing inside of an oven to dry the crystals out again. Doesn't work well in large areas, even with multiple packages.	This little unit is efficient for smaller environments that aren't overly  humid. If you have a large safe or super damp space, this might not be the most practical option. The case is durable, and I like that there's a green indicator light that tells you when you need to dry it in the oven. I'd recommend it for a jewelry box, smaller weapons safe, or a cabinet with documents.
home_kitchen	B0036SGFXO	I had in the past bought and a chicken roaster in South Africa but I now cannot find anyone who sells them. I went on to Amazon and found this product and I have received them and am very happy with my purchase.	My husband and I use this all the time to cook whole chickens now. We don't bother putting a beer can in it. I've used it several times on the grill as well as in the oven. The chicken comes out perfectly cooked and the skin nice and crispy every time!	I like the pan under the chicken to catch the drippings, but it is awful tall. even using the bottom rack of my oven the chicken almost touches the broiler. no way it would fit in our bbq. it really makes great tasting chicken!!	VERY EASY TO USE AND LOVED THE WAY THE CHICKEN COOKED. JUST ANOTHER GREAT WAY OF COOKING ON YOUR GRILL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO TURN IT AROUND. YOU PUT IT ON YOUR GRILL AND GO DO YOUR SIDE DISHES WHILE YOUR CHICKEN IS DONE.	Works well, a little small thou. I usually get the biggest roaster chicken I can find (usually 6-7lbs) but this seems a little small for that size chicken (5 - 6lbs would fit better). However, love the drip pan feature, it collects all the juices so you can baste! For the price, I would Definately recomend it!	Five stars for the collapsible design. It holds a normal size beer can but not a bottle. I only use it as a stand (humidity is irrelevant for a Char-broil infrared cooker), and it is very solid. Goes right on the rack or grill without any fear of tipping, and holds a large chicken.	This worked okay, but it didn't make much change for our grilling. I thought my husband would love it, but he was pretty apathetic... and we've only used it once - as it's a bit cumbersome. So, I guess it's okay but not 'necessary.'	This is a perfect substitute for doing rotisserie chicken in the winter when the Barbie won't heat up to temp. I use two of them at the same time to put two chickens in the oven at 475 degrees coated with Sams Rotisserie Rub and it turns out perfect every time... no beer can needed- the chickens stay moist on there own.	This chicken roaster works both in the oven and on the grill. It's a great way to cook a whole chicken and has a pan underneath to catch all the drippings. It can be used with a beer can or without, and holds a large chicken. It's a little tall, so it may not work in all ovens and barbecue grills.	Excellent for cooking whole chickens perfectly when traditional grilling is not possible or inconvenient. Features a collapsible design and the drip pan underneath catches any drippings making for an easy clean up, or to use for basting. Best for medium sized chickens so it properly fits inside the oven or grill.	the chicken roaster is a good product. makes delicious chicken, has a way to put a beer can in to produce a good crunchy crust. is a little small if you are used making a big chicken, also need to keep in mind that roaster adds to the size, so it might be too big for the over or the grill.
home_kitchen	B00442C8RS	Very different from what I'm used to which is a regular freezer ice maker. It's kind of a process if you use all the time, which I do, you develop a system. Makes ice fast. Simple to operate.	Gave this as a gift to my daughter and son-in-law for their deck. The have numerous pool parties and according to my daughter, this works great. It prevents wet feet from going in the house to get ice. It fits nicely on their deck and they seem to be enjoying it.	I thought this was exactly like my current ice maker but when it got here it wasn't. Once seeing it I wondered what size it was going to make but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the large cubes. It ended up being all it was advertised to be and I love it. I would recommend it to all.	This thing works like a charm. We use it in our bar at home and in our RV when traveling. You just have to remember to empty it when not in use and keep it clean. It does the job for parties! Very fast and efficient.	absolutely love it!!! this is the 2nd one we have. The 1st one lasted 8 years!!! I love having ice made all the time. I have it made by the refrigerator also but I love this machine better.	It worked as advertised although I didn't check to see if it make the actual 27 pounds per day. I bought it for the camper and seemed to satisfy the demand for ice. It sure beats paying $3 / bag at the camp store. It won't take long to pay for it.	So far I love this device. It cranks out ice in minutes. Perfect to have for entertaining, We actually bought this as a back up for our unreliable built in ice maker in our fridge. This has saved the day.	We have had this machine for 2 years. It sits outside on our patio in Arizona. It hits 115 degrees in the summer. It has been cleaned one a month and has NEVER stopped or had any kind of problems. We just keep filling it with water and it keeps making ice 24 / 7 / 365.	Perfect ice maker for camping or any large gathering. It makes large ice cubes quickly and is easy to use. It works as advertised and saves you from spending money on pre-made ice at the store. It's also well made and if well maintained, it will last for years. I highly recommend it.	Awesome ice maker that is easy to use, makes ice quickly, and is much more reliable than most ice makers built into refrigerators. Works well for parties and entertaining, RV traveling, as well as to save money not needing to buy ice from the store. It will eventually pay for itself!	This ice machine is pretty much perfect for any environment. We've had it sitting outside all day in the heat during parties and we've taken it along in our RV for ice at the campsite. It makes nice large ice cubes 24/7. It's so simple to use that my young kids usually take care of it, and it's easy to clean, too. If you do a lot of entertaining or camping, you can't go wrong with this ice machine.
home_kitchen	B00455NTOU	It worked great for 6 months and suddenly stopped working. CucinaPro customer care was pretty useful in replacing the defective one with brand new one within a week. Thanks for a great customer service!!! Hopefully, this one won't go bad in next 6 months.	The machine is very tricky. It requires some trial and errors to make it work right. I do not like to put oil in the dough; however, it appears to me that without oil it is impossible to make tortilla or chapatti. It is useless for me.	I love this tortilla maker. I hate to buy them from the store and they sit in my fridge. This way I make them on the night we eat them. Yes you should grill them after to get the toasted look.	Great machine!!! I use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time. I also make pizza crusts, pancakes and crepes. You have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy. Love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch.	For this price, plus the pennys you'll spend on a 3-4 ingredient mix, this appliance pays for itself in about 2 months at our house. Tortillas taste so fresh, no yucky preservatives, and you'll save TONS not buying anymore bleached white over-priced tortillas at the grocery store.	I noticed that several reviews indicated that users were using this machine to both press and cook their tortillas. This machine works in the same way as the 3000 dollar tortilla press except no automatic operation, that said a tortilla press needs to be hot to keep the tortilla from shrinking, however the tortilla needs to be finished cooking on a griddle for best results.	Fun and easy to use! Took me one batch to get my technique worked out, but it was very simple, easy to follow directions. Easy clean up too! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric tortilla maker!	I bought this for my boyfriend for making Roti but it flattens too much and so you don't get the air pockets and flakiness that you want in roti. Probably great and easy for tortillas but we just don't eat them.	Great value machine.  After a few trial runs, you can make the perfect tortilla.  It can also make an array of other edibles such as crepes and pizza crusts.  It is not so good for dough that requires air pockets as it is a press, but for tortillas, it's great.  Customer service is very responsive and helpful.	The CucinaPro Tortilla maker is worth the money. It's a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you get fresh, homemade tortillas that taste great. It works just like the more expensive presses. Their customer service is fantastic, very helpful. I would recommend this to any home cook.	I love this tortilla maker. It's fun, easy to use and easy to clean up too. The machine performs same function as a 3000 dollar tortilla press but has no automatic operation. This product also have a good customer service as it replaced a defective one within a week.

I have to turn it so the side that has the air coming out is facing me.Piece of crap..... don't waste your money! Perfect example of 'you get what you pay for'. >: (	This fan takes up very little space and is pretty quiet. Since it's fairly tall, it can blow in your face when you're sitting down. It would be nice to be able to change the degree of oscillation, but that's not a huge deal.	I've had this for two months now, and I've noticed that it feels like there's only air coming out of one side. Bummer. Not sure what could be the problem, but it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend.	It's not that powerful unless you are all of a few inches from it. It wobbles a bit and after a few weeks of use it starts to squeak if you use the oscillating setting. I wish I wouldn't have cheaped out and bought a better more expensive fan.	This fan is pretty noisy in my sons small bedroom but I only really put it on the lowest setting so it's no big deal. What bothers me about it is that the fan blows out to the side of the vents rather than in the middle so I have to really play with it to aim it properly.	This fan is a horrible purchase. It doesn't blow air straight ahead. You have to turn the fan at an angle to feel any wind AND only if on high and within 24 inches. It was such a waste of money, I now have to buy another fan.	This tower fan is the right size, the right color. But the air flows from the side of the vent not from the full vent. You have to turn the fan almost to the wall to get the benefit of the fan. I would not recommend this fan.	My fan arrived with an out of balance blade assembly and had to be returned. The base is too small, which lets the tower sway. I ordered the Holmes HTF3211AR-BU and for a few extra dollars got a fan with a bigger base and remote control. Much better quality.	This fan is a great size as it doesn't take up too much space. However, the airflow doesn't come out from the middle rather it comes out from the sides. Because of this, you have to play with the position to get the benefits of the cooling aspect. I would not recommend this for daily use.	This is a cheap fan that doesn't work well. Air only comes out of one side, instead of out the front, and is very weak. You can't use oscillate if you wan't to feel any blowing air. I don't recommend this fan. Spend a little more money and get one that is much better.	I bought this fan to keep right next to me when I'm working at my desk or reading, and for this purpose, it works great. There's plenty of airflow for a personal fan, but if you are trying to cool a room, this is not a good option. The air only comes out one side for some reason, so I do need to angle it appropriately. It also does not oscillate, but I knew that it didn't have that feature when I ordered it. It's a bit noisy, so probably not ideal for a super quiet office environment.

I got a canister to avoid having a heavy weight on my arm, but his one is heavier than expected.	My first Miele vacuum... great to use on hardwood floors, tile and area rugs. Could be better for wall to wall carpeting but there are more expensive Miele vacuums for that purpose. Like that it has special filters to remove allergens from air and love that it is so lightweight.	Too bad there isn't a way to rate this higher 'cause I would. Very quite. A little pricey, but you get a quality product for your money. Wife likes it, and has vacuumed more than she used to with the old vacuum it's so much easier to use. And did I mention quiet?	I moved from a house that had a cental vacuum system. I was concerned about how happy I would be with a separate vacuum cleaner (not central system). I love my new Miele vacuum cleaner! It is stronger than my central vacuum for me! Pathetic canister moves with ease and the retractable ford is great. Love this system!!!!	From the get go, this vacuum is a keeper. It is super quiet yet has the suction power of a shop-vac. The vacuum is simple to use and lightweight. Our only issue was that the box was very damaged upon receipt, but there is no apparent damage to the machine. Concerning that it would even be shipped due to the box damage.	It really sucks. What do I mean. Well, first, it really does a great job of sucking up dirt, always a good ability for a vacuum cleaner. It also sucks because the replacement bags are pricey and need to be changed out every other month in our cat and child-filled household.	Very high quality vacuum. Read the reviews before you buy. The old reliable names are no longer the same quality. Miele is one of the best. You get what you pay for. Thanks Amazon for making my choices easier to research and purchase.	I can't believe we went so long without the Miele! For years we fell for the Dyson gimmicks and I honestly feel stupid about the amount of money we have thrown at them after a few months with the Miele. It is so quiet and super light and unlike the Dyson it will actually do carpets!	The lightweight, quiet and easy to use Miele vacuum is a great and favorable against other competitors Vacuum's such as Dyson. The Miele has filters that help with eliminating allergens from the air. One thing regarding the bag replacements is that they can be a little pricey. Overall the Miele vacuum is recommended.	A really great quality vacuum from Miele such a good product. Really handy to use around the house on rugs, carpet or hardwood floors and its lightweight. It was a little pricey but what is price when it does a good job. Also its really quiet as well. I give it a thumbs up.	This Miele vacuum is wonderful at sucking up dirt.  It is quiet, and easy to use.  The price is a bit higher than other vacuums on the market but the quality of the product is reflected in its price.  This is a bagged vacuum, so there is an added expense of the bags to be factored in.
home_kitchen	B006NNLX2C	Not sure I really like this. Because it's made of silicone, it's very flexible. That means it spills easily. It's also quite small, as other reviewers have pointed out. It's good for making small portions for one or two people.	The item cooks a small serving of vegetables okay but its so floppy to hold onto that I won't buy anymore silicone cookwear / bakewear. My microwave is up over the stove and its too hard to hold onto a floppy item when taking it out and its hot.	I have used this steamer every day since I have gotten it. It steams zucchini perfect in as little as 2 minutes. It makes perfect steamed cauliflower in 3 minutes. I will never tire of how fast it makes my vegetables and the ease of clean up time!!	I love this steamer and am purchasing a second one! It's a great size for a single person to steam veggies or even microwave fish, and the silicone makes it so easy to clean and store. The apple green color is cheerful and I love I can eat from the container (I hate doing dishes LOL).	I liked this steamer when I got it, but it has gotten to be a very unstable item to try and use. I hate taking it out of microwave when hot because I am afraid of it dumping hot food all over me.	I'm glad I tried this steamer. It is so easy to use and the veggie and fish tasted so much better! I think this will help me to stick to my weight loss goal by keeping me full eating more veggies.	As previously reviewed, this steamer is not overly sized. Perfect for single servings / possibly two. Easy to clean. I have a steam setting on my microwave that protests that the lid doesn't fit snuggly enough. Again, you get what you pay for.	I use it all the time for my veggies. It steams my broccoli or green beans in 2.5-3 mins and they are perfect. The container is flimsy and can be hot out of microwave, but rinses off easily and is rest to go again.	The steamer is ideal for making single servings of veggies. I am not able to use this to make large batches at once. It is easy and quick to clean. However, the product is very flimsy and it is easy to spill the food. Overall, I would not recommend this because of the mess that it makes.	This steamer is perfect for someone cooking a single serving for themselves. Anyone cooking for anyone other than themselves, however, will probably not enjoy this product as it is very small and only cooks a small portion at a time. Also, it is made of silicone so the flimsy material causes spills if you are not careful and it is very hot when you pull it out of the microwave.	If you love steamed veggies this is the dream steamer you should have at home. The steamer takes less space in kitchen and very quick to steam all kind of veggies. Very easy to to use and easy to clean. It will steam veggies for a serving for two people at a time.
home_kitchen	B006Y401K0	I just redid my kitchen all in purple. This is a great color and it is really big. I bought two of them and I am so happy, it holds a lot of utensils. And very pretty too. It is sturdy, not cheap junk.	I was having such a hard time finding a large enough utensil crock, that of course also matched my d\u00e9cor. I have the chunky orange utensil set from Rachael Ray & definitely needed something this size. It's perfect & beautiful. Love it!	This utensil crock met all my expectations! I love the color and it holds quite a few kitchen tools! I'm glad I DIDN 'T go with the 1qt. size! Great size, fits easily in a corner on my countertop! If you need a handy storage containter and want it to look great on your counter top this is what you want!	For some reason the crock shows to be taller and slimmer in THIS COLOR, but it's not. It's the wider and slightly shorter one I wanted. It's very pretty. Plenty room for everything, including the utinsils with the larger rubber handles.	This crock is very large and gives you plenty of room for utensils (especially now that many utensils have the thick rubber handles). I was able to condense from 2 drawers to 1 now that I have this crock on the counter. Seems very high quality and looks beautiful.	Tired of fighting to get my cooking utensils out of another type of vessel Le Creuset proves once again to be my top choice in the kitchen. This crock gives plenty of space for over a dozen everyday utensils, looks perfect on the counter and is not too large getting in the way of work space. The white color is classic for any decor.	I LOVE this utensil crock! Le Creuset has never let me down and the color is just fabulous. By being larger than expected, I was delighted to find that ALL my cooking tools fit, with room to spare. Its a perfect addition to my kitchen, and its a magnificent color.	I love the color and it fits in with other pieces that I have. It is a good size for holding items. It is a slightly different shape than the one I already had so it makes a nice contrast sitting on the counter top.	This product is a great addition to any kitchen! The color is fantastic and it's sturdy build is perfect for holding as many kitchen utensils as it does! It holds a lot of utensils without being too big and bulky so it fits nicely on the kitchen cabinet. Definitely would recommend for any kitchen!	This Le Creuset crock is sizable, able to hold over a dozen utensils, including ones with thick rubber handles. It will save drawer space, and be an attractive addition to any kitchen.	The utensil crock Le Creuset is a perfect fit for any kitchen. You will love the color and the space to hold many kitchen tools. It takes smaller space but give you bigger space to store key utensils at one spot. Definitely recommend this Simply beautiful and reliable product.
