cloth	B0013EQ20Y	i really like these boots. they can be a beast to get on, like any boot fit to last; once on, they are incredibly comfortable. I have had them for 4 years and they still look great - worn in but not worn out...	What great boots! They do take some breaking in - like all real leather does. Run maybe a tad small in the general spectrum, but hey, remember the break in period. Look fabulous, will last me for the next twenty years.... They bridge the fashion vs. function quandary beautifully.	Every woman needs a pair of these Frye boots! Fit is true to normal size. I wear a standard 9. These fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as I do. You have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in. Worth the money and break in time.	Boots excellent quality, beautiful skin, a modern model. But! they are very narrow! This is the second pair of shoes is a brand and my 8.5 size fits me perfectly, even he little more than usual. But these are very narrow! go to a cobbler, let him try to stretch. Be careful!	bought these for the wife to have something to kick around in and keep up with the kids, but she doesn't like them. Her heel lifts with every step, and they're stiff and heavy. Not an everyday casual shoe.	Don't get me wrong, they're really good boots, but they used to make them better. My last pair from a few years ago were much higher quality. Thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. Keeping them, but still disappointed in Frye.	i bought it just for the heavy snow cuz my UGG got wet through.even though it is a little expensive, but the boots are nice and it was shipped to me for only two days.!!!!!! i love it	They were comfortable the moment I put them on. The sizes are exact. The color the way they are made are what I expect from Frye which I've been wearing since the 70's. With a 20year break from not wearing Frye it was a pleasant surprise the quality has stood the test of time.	Nice boots but run a bit narrow. They look great but I think the quality has come down over the years. Still comfortable but I wish they broke in easier. I recommend these for any lady who is patient and looking for comfort.	These boots run fairly true-to-size, but they aren't super easy to get on at first. They're comfortable, but a short break-in period is needed, at least in my experience. They look great on and they're very durable, but they are not the lightest boots you can wear. As long as you aren't expecting feather light footwear, this shouldn't be a problem. They are a nice blend of function and fashion and that's not always easy to find in boots.	These boots are great, excellent quality, incredibly comfortable and the sizes are exact. It's a little expensive, but will last me for about twenty years. The shipping was fast, two days. I love it.
cloth	B001QCZ3E4	This shoe is very classy and chic. The colour is rich and goes very well with almost any navy blue outfit. However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader. And you do have to order the size a 1 / 2 inch bigger than you normally wear.	this shoe was picked by the 'bride to be' for her upcoming wedding this weekend. The other bridesmaids paid over $80.00 in a dept. store. I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly.	I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area.	These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable.	These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute.	I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!	These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable.	Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for. I'm five months pregnant and needed a comfortable shoe for a wedding and these completely fit the bill. I would buy again.	Very pretty shoes and nice quality. The shoes run a bit small, about half a size and there is a ridge in the shoe that rubs on your toe. Nice formal night shoe, not so much for every day.	Great fast amazon shipping. This shoe is very chic, classic and with a rich color that blends with almost any navy blue colored outfit. I love the look of the shoes and would be forever special to me. There is a rim inside the topmost part of the shoes that could cause blister to my toes.	These shoes are best fit and nice looking for parties or specially for wedding functions. The toe of the show can be a challenge for some feet and may make the feet sore due to the rim to keep the shape perfect. Overall price wise and looks are great and would recommend for long term use.
cloth	B0040EIHQQ	This pendant is so unique!! The design is beautiful and the bail is a ring instead of the typical bail which gives it a nice touch!! All the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.I cannot say anything about the chain because used our own chain.:) Satisfied.	It look perfect in a womens neck!! great gift, I thought for the price it was going to look cheap, but I was far wrong. It look great.Spect great reward from your woman when you give this to her; D	The prettiest sterling silver piece I own now. I get so many compliments on this necklace. I bought it for myself from my hubby for Valentine's Day. Why not? When people ask where I got it, I simply say from my loving hubby. And he is off the hook as to what to get me. win + win.	I love hearts and I love 'love':) I do not have any negative feedback, the necklace is perfect and the charm is perfect. I just thought it would have been slightly bigger. Overall, I love my new heart necklace.	When I received the package, I was surprised and amazed because the necklace is so elegant, beautiful and the same as the picture shown here. I really love this necklace. It has a unique pendant designed. I will recommend it to someone to order it now...	Item is nice. Not a great quality item, but right for the price. Charm was larger than I expected (I expected small and elegant, but it was large and almost costume jewelry like). I think it is a good necklace, just not what I expected.	I got this as a present for my GF on Valintines day. She loves it and wears it every day! Its not cheap looking and it hasn't broken yet. The chain hasn't broken either even though it is very thin. Strongly recomend it!	Over all service has been great the only problem, I ordered a purple Mickey Mouse case for iPhone 4S they sent a black, n I felt it was to much trouble n such a small item to send back so needless to say its put back in a drawer somewhere	The necklace is very unique and a great quality for the price.  The charm isn't exactly what is pictured as far as size goes but still very beautiful.  The chain is a bit thin but seems to have good durability. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking to add a beautiful piece to their jewelry collection.	This necklace is beautiful and well-made for the price. Even though the chain is thin it hasn't broken. The pendant is really nice, but it is hard to tell the size from the photos. It would look great around the neck of any woman you get it for!	This necklace is a beautiful and unique piece to add to your own or a loved one's jewlery collection. The pendant is unique and the bail is a ring making this sterling silver necklace an elegant looking piece. It has a very strong chain also so it can be shown off and enjoyed for a long time.
cloth	B0052PKEYK	Although the quality of construction seems adequate, the sizing isn't accurate. I ordered a size 34 which is the size I normally wear and the suit not only pinches around my legs but also is almost uncomfortably tight around the waist.	The suit seemed ok in quality however it was the wrong size. It is always a gamble buying online even following the sizing chart. I did return it and got a refund but Amazon failed to fight for the sale and make it right. I went to a local store and purchased what I liked.	Fits well and has a nice draw string to keep them tight. I bought a size small so that I would not have to worry about them falling off but I should have bought my correct size as they fit true to size.	The only reason for the 1-star reduction, is the seams around the legs are pretty stiff and tight. However, the seams appear to be loosening up a bit though with use. I typically wear a size 32 but had to get a 34 for this suit.	The size on the waist was correct, but if you have large thighs like I do, or should I say muscular thighs, it will be a tight fit. It is very tight to get past my thighs, then it wasn't so bad. The waist was a 38, no problem there. It will be a tight fit on most guys.	I got this swimsuit a month ago. I swim 5 days a week for about an hour and 15 min. I washed the suit after every practice. It tookabout 2 weeks for a fabric to loose all elasticity. After two more weeks the suit basically fell apart. Avoid!	I wear a 32 and I read some of the reviews and yes it does have a nice feel and fit but does run small with that being said I ordered a 34 and it was a nice fit and feel but I think a 36 would have been a better fut	I haven't swam in it much yet but fit is good. I bought two different styles. Both were speedos. I am not a swimmer so this is a first purchase of speedos. Training for my 3rd marathon and wanted to add swimming as part of my workout.	The suit fits ok on me, it is good around the waist but tight in the legs/thighs. I will probably return this and move up a size, it's easier to use the drawstring on the waist than deal with a swimsuit strangling my thighs. Consider a larger size than normal if you have large thighs.	This suit is a good fit for me. It may fit tight on guys with large thighs. I like the feel of this suit and the style is good for anyone swimming as a workout or doing any real training. It may run a bit small though it does seem to stretch at the seams with use and wear.	The suit tends to run a bit small as the fitting in the waist was adequate but it was tight in the thighs. After heavy use the seams tend to loosen up and even loose the elasticity over time. Overall it's a nice suit, has a nice feel, and is nicely constructed.
cloth	B005BQ6YYO	Fit as expected. Have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. Looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. These work great for me but not for all day use.	The shoe is so comfortable and I bought another 'walking' shoe by Ahnu which is perfect too.Needed a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in Europe this Spring. These will fit the bill.I found this style was a little big so I had to get a half size smaller and it is great.LO	Reviews said to buy a size smaller. I wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. It was still too big, and I'm guessing a 6 would fit. I bought the Ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6.	I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size.	I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right.	I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly.	I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!	I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight! I bet I could run in these. Great all around casual working shoe.	"This is the perfect ""comfy shoe,"" great for walking around town or casual get togethers. Cute and functional!  They do run a bit big, plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual. Another very comfortable shoe by Ahnu, would definitely buy again!"	These shoes are lightweight, comfortable, have plenty of support, and are slip resistant. They're great for walking and working, and they look quite nice as well. The only issue is that their size measurements seem inaccurate. You may end up needing to get a size that is either smaller or larger than what you normally get.	Nice, lightweight, comfortable shoes for casual use like walking- if they fit you well. Sizing is confusing, tends to run large and not fit well on wider feet. Expect to need 1/2 size to 1 full size smaller than your normal shoe size.  Try these on in person if possible!
cloth	B005DO7R3G	I usually wear size 37, but found a 38 feels better in this sandal. I absolutely love this sandal. So supportive and comfortable, although at first I did get a blister on my big toe. Do not let this be the deciding factor. It stretched out and is now fabulous. I love it so much that I bought it in three colors.	This is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. The strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but I have very slim feet. I can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet.	I love these sandals. The fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. I don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. They are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses.	My wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. We were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. Some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. We gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them...	Finally, a Dansko sandal that's fashion forward! It was love at first sight! This is my 4th Dansko purchase. Their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. I love the stying of this sandal and I'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. Another feature I love is the Dri-Lex topsole - it's soft and keeps feet dry.	I really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as I have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. I'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears	I have several pairs of Dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. So I felt confident when I ordered the Tasha Sandal in size 39. I don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. Otherwise, I love them. They are very cushiony and comfortable!	I own many Dansko shoes and these are among my favorites. They have ALL the support that Dansko offers in its shoes plus they are very attractive. I love the the heel height and instant comfort. They look great with slacks and dresses, dressed up or not...	I love these sandals, Dansko has made a really great product! I had to return my first pair (39) for being a bit tight and small, but I went a size higher (40) and it is perfect, they are so comfortable! If they do stretch out like other reviews say, they will still fit and look great.	I love these Dansko Tasha sandals! They are comfortable and the style is really cute. The only warning I have is that they seem to run narrow: you may want to buy a larger size if you have wide feet. Also, they seem to stretch as you wear them, so don't get discouraged by a few blisters on first wearing.	These Dansko shoes are amazingly comfortable and hug the shape of my feet well, but I did have to wear them for a bit to stretch them out. They felt a little tight at first, but now they are perfect. I feel they're true to size so I'd recommend ordering these in your normal shoe size.
cloth	B007I8G8A8	Love the shorts! Fit beautifully and look great on my hunky hubby! We grew up at the beach and these are definitely back flashes!! Excellent quality, good material, made very well and am very excited! I need to order him more!	As other people mentioned the liner in these are SUPER small. I took them on vacation to Hawaii and on the second day I cut out the bottom of the liner. The waist fits fine but the liner inside is not sized accordingly. I just cut the liner at the bottom so I could be comfortable and all was well after that.	great price nice style these were the best swimwear available during the winter season and compared to the others that i found online these were very sharp (style) and also the price was very decent if your son needs a pair for gym or just swimming i would recommend these to any one	Shorts have a good look and feel. Fit about as expected but the mesh is a little tighter than I'd like. (6 '205lb, wear a size 34 waist and ordered the size large which is quoted to fit a 34.) If you're on the fence, might want to go a size larger.	My wife said I had to buy a proper pair of swim trunks for an upcoming cruise. Seems my use of cut off jeans would embarrass her on the cruise we took. The pockets are deep enough to keep things in and the cargo pockets are good for keeping various items like sunglasses.I guess I will have to retire the cutoffs.	The shorts themselves fit well, but my husband said the inner lining was a little tight. He ended up not wearing them because he was worried about them chaffing. Hopefully they can be stretched or fixed, but I'm not sure.	This is a cheap product and it shows in the material and craftsmanship. The material is rough and it has one of those annoying net liners built in. The stitching seems poorly done and I don't thin it would have lasted long had I actually worn it out into the ocean. I returned the item.	This was an excellent purchase - very sharp looking and seemingly well made (so far anyway) for a great price. What garners only a 4 star is the mesh inner lining is a bit too tight and i had to cut it	These look very nice on.  The mesh in them run a little tight though so you may want to go up in size.  They are roomy in the pockets and can hold onto a lot of items.  They are a great price for the quality and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new pair of swim trunks.	These swim trunks look great and the waist fits as expected for the size. They are also a good deal for the price. However, the inner mesh liner is much smaller than the size of the outer trunks. You will probably have to cut out the mesh liner to wear them comfortably.	These are nice fitting shorts but the mesh liner felt tight and I cut it out. You might want to size up if you are unsure. The deep pockets come in handy. These shorts are stylish and they look good. They are more comfortable if the inner mesh liner is removed.
cloth	B009L0KU46	The shoes are the perfect fit for me. They supply the support that I need yet are flexible and comfortable. I wear these all day in my 2nd grade classroom and my feet are not tired at the end of the day. I will be buying another pair in a different color.	I overpronate and should have known better than to buy these shoes. They are really sharp looking and probably would work for someone with a regular feet. I wish I could have kept them as I did get lots of compliments at the gym when wearing them;)	It is very comfortable and the bottom is really soft on my feet. I usually wear 8 but I had to get a 7 in this. So it ran large for me. I have wide feet though too. Very stylish. I enjoy wearing them running and casually as well.	Got a blister the first time wearing them. They did nothing for the foot pain experienced from wearing cheaper shoes. Guess I was expecting too much, but I refuse to pay the ridiculously high prices charged nowadays. I'm sure they are just as good as those costing $100 more. Nice colors!	These shoes are awsome. I have a really hard time finding running shoes due to a high arch and the need for a shoe between a neutral shoe and a stability shoe These shoes felt great right out of the box. They run true to size and the colors are great. Great shoe for a great price.	These are a MUST HAVE item...!! They are totally awesome on my feet and feel like a dream. I do a lot of power-walking and these little cuties are RAD..!! Totally light weight but real cushie..... LOVE EM 'and would DEFINITELY buy from this seller again..!!	I usually wear a size Women's 10. Nike shoes run small, so I usually waer an 11 in Nike. These Reeboks fit more true to size, but I still ordered a 10.5 and the fit is great! The shoe seems durable and well-made. It forms to my foot and supports my arch very well.	She loves the shoes! My girlfriend is picky about shoes and avoids online purchases. I asked her to find a pair of athletic shoes that look attractive. She gave me her size and I purchased them. They are lightweight and she says they cushion her feet well. She has been wearing them for long walks and tandem bike rides since she received them!	These are lightweight, durable and supportive shoes. They look great and the cushion is quite comfortable. They are perfect for people who have to stand on their feet all day. They feel lightweight on the foot and are great for people with regular sized foot. However, they may not work for someone with very wide feet. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone who needs a supportive comfortable shoe.	I love the look of these shoes, and everyone in my walking group has commented on how great they look! I took the advice of others and ordered a size smaller. They fit just right and are very comfortable. I walk for two hours, 4 times a week, and these shoes have been just what I need.	I love these shoes! They give me great arch support and are very well-made. They fit pretty true to size, but make sure you utilize the sizing chart listed. They are perfect for my daily walk. I love the color. I did get a blister the first time I wore them, but that always happens to me. They just need to be broken in. Now they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had.
electronics	B000BYGGBW	Yes, HP DVD's are DVD's for the better. Better price. Better quality. I have used these over the years for many different projects and the quality is there and so is the price. I have had trouble with some other brand named DVD's, but not with HP.	Ive always bought the Hp DVD + R 100 pk and find that they go a long way, Seldom do I find a coaster in the pack... Hwever his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from Amazon, but so far so good.	I have had a ton a problems with these discs. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. Looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and I guess picked again. Do not recommend.	The box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank DVD in place was broken and DVD were off the spindle. If that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all.	Produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on DVD players. The first half was about what I expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. The second half I was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. No good!	After receiving this DVD + R, I think I should order the 50 piece spindle. I did not burn too often. I believe it is enough for 2 years. I tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it.	Been purchasing only HP DVD + R media for 8 years or more. Always got the HP branded gold coated. Made by CMC, with id of CMCMAGM01001. This batch is not gold as portrayed in the photo, it's silver coated, but still the same id.	Vendor describes the product as being gold in color. It is not it is silver. I know that HP no longer manufactures the gold version.But was hoping this vendor had some gold version of DVD + R in it inventory. They need change the picture and description to silver instead of gold.	These are silver discs, not the gold ones as advertised. The packaging is not good, they need to be packed more securely, the DVDs shouldn't be able to slide around.  The quality of the DVDs is hit or miss. You might have a good batch and then run into several that won't work.	I've always used HP DVD + R discs, but these are silver instead of the gold they used to be. These silver ones are hit or miss. I'll burn 10 DVDs no problem, then get a few coaster in a row. I wish the gold DVD + R were still around. I'm glad I bought the 100 pack in case I have any other issues.	These DVDs work well for the most part, although I did get some coasters. Some seem to work but become choppy about 30 minutes into the video. HP is still better than most other brands though. Take note that these are silver, not gold. Hopefully the vendor updates their images.
electronics	B000V7CPJG	I recently bought this film and slide scanner to scan my grandfather's slide collection. It bleaches out the image with too much light. I tried changing the settings to improve the image quality, but had no luck. The company ArcSoft charges $10.00 per phone call for tech support. You are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner.	* * Not Reccommended * * Purchased as a gift in August. Opened a week ago. Spent the last week trying to get Win Xp to recognise the Vu Point scanner. Many drivers and reloads later all I have is a little black box with a red light and a message from windows that says 'USB Device Not Recognised'.	I used the VuPoint Digital Scanner to scan over 1,200 35 mm negatives and about a dozen slides and found this gadget a most user-friendly and efficient tool. I even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. I recommend the product highly.	While the software was good for Windows XP and Vista, I now have Windows 7 and would like to have software for the newer operating system. The company prefers to sell other products rather than update their software. I can't see recommending this product in today's market.	While most equipment will work with more modern versions of Windows than were available when manufactured this is not true with this scanner. Requires Windows XP means it won't work with earlier OR LATER. Its on its way back for a refund.	I found the VuPoint scanner not acceptable and I am still waiting for a replacement. My contacts with VuPoint were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. My contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.I an NOT anxious to deal with these providers again.	Product is very easy to use. Does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. Touch-up and enhance program gave me just what I needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, Company was great to work with!!	Its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you. I'd much rather buy a hp flat bed scanner that lets you see the final photo image and not just an image of the negative. It takes to much time and isn't worth the money.	overall impression of the product is negative. in some cases it works nicely, but the settings are confusing to adjust, sometimes it is not clear if they do anything at all. product is not worth the money that it costs, it better to avoid it.	The product is easy to use. It converted to digital format my slide and photo negatives. Very efficient and user friendly tool. It is mostly compatible for Windows Xp.  The product is not recommended for today's market.	I seems that the VuPoint scanner seems like a good product but between the inconpatable software and trouble with placing the negatives in, many customers dont have the time and want instant results. i would give this scanner a good review if you cant afford a more high product. you wont get a better enhancement feature on a more higher end scanner. Give it a try or return it if you dont like it
electronics	B002RL8IGI	Took a long time to get and when I finally got them, they didn't seem to work to well joined up (I have 3). Also, they should have come with DC chargers, they don't seem to work well with batteries, imho.	The units work fine and the setup is described in the manual works well. The one thing that my wife and I do not like is the Audio. Sounds like you are in a box. The calling button is also a bit strange. It first beeps and then you can speak. The distance it covers is very good.	Don't waste your money on these. Although if you try hard enough you can make out what the other person is saying, the audio quality is extremely poor, as is the noise cancellation (if any), and the general sound quality. I wish I had saved the boxes. I'd be sending these back.	And the problem is having to wake the kids up in the morning to go to school. They are upstairs and I used to have to trek up and down a couple of times each morning. We put one in each bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the study. Problem solved.	We use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold, but that is about all it is good for. Don't bother trying to have a conversation, clarity is too poor. I didn't realize until after the fact that I should have just bought walkie talkies. At least battery life in these are good.	I searched extensively for an intercom for my large two floor home. I selected this unit (ordering three units) and regret my decision. It was very difficult set up and doesnot work that well. I wish I could get a refund as we never use it. My search continues.	It is simple to program and operate, which is just what I was looking for. I just wish I didn't have to buy a power cord separately. I am running it on batteries right now, but I am not sure how long they will last.	I've spent hours already trying to set up my network and get this system going. The engineering leaves much to be desired. Can't get it to work as advertised. The Manual is one of the least helpful such documents I've ever seen.	If you are looking for a basic intercom system and nothing fancy, then this product is for you. It is perfect for what I need it for. They do not come with cords, so make sure you have batteries. It has a good range of coverage. All units work well, and the setup was easy as described in the manual. They are simple to use and my kids love them! Great product for the price.	These intercoms are not worth the buy. Getting these set up is quite the hassle and the instruction manual is not much aid. The worst part is that the sound quality is very poor. This may have some use if a simple message is to be sent. Otherwise, don't waste your money.	This does not come with an AC charger so you have to use batteries or buy a cord separately. I think this covers a good distance and the battery life seems good. The audio is not great, it is not very clear. It is challenging to set up. Walkie talkies would work about as well.
electronics	B003U8K0N6	This power supply gets the job done but I am concerned about how hot the charger gets after a few hours. I attached a cooling device to the power supply and has controlled the heat. Buy this with caution and monitor the temperature of the power supply.	This charger ruined my laptop. I did not have any problems with my 5month old lap top until i used this charger. Buy this from the manufacture and you will be better off. Go to ACER and bet it from them.	My charger gets hot very quick. The one pictured is not the on received. The prong fits loose in the laptop. The one pictured showed a grounded plug with an OEM Brick. The one received has a 2 prong plug and has a sticker on it stating, replacement AC Adapter, Made in China.It would be nice if the pictures represent the real items.	I recently purchased this power supply and cord to replace the OEM that stopped working. I've had it approximately 1 month and works perfectly. The cord is a little shorter than the original but that isn't much of an issue for me. I would recommend this product.	I bought this for my aspire 5532. It worked for about a week and now it won't charge at all. The fit was never snug from the start, but I was hopeful. I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!	The charger arrived here very quickly! I am very thankful for that because I have online classes to work on for school. The only thing is the cord has to be placed a specific way or it will not charge so that is difficult.	Purchased the product for the corresponding laptop. The adapter made so much noise that I could not charge the computer in the office. After writing the company they took appx 5 days to get back to me and suggested that I send the product back on my dime to fix the problem. Poor product, bad customer service, I do not recommend.	I ordered this for my Acer 5532. It heats up right away and I only use it to charge the laptop, it isn't plugged in for very long. After only 2 weeks it MELTED! This is horrible and dangerous!	The charger gets very hot with use, which can be quite concerning. The fit into the laptop is often loose, which makes it unreliable. Some items delivered didn't resemble the photo online. Overall, it would be best to avoid this product and buy direct from the manufacturer.	This charger gets very hot very fast and it seems a bit dangerous. It has to be lined up a certain way to work. The charger makes a bit of noise. Customer service was not helpful. A cooling device may help with the heat but this product should be used with caution. It is an affordable option.	This product is of very poor quality. This charger is not reliable. It gets very hot and is loud and may ruin your device. It does not look the product in the description and customer service is not quick to help. Overall, I definitely do not recommend this product.
electronics	B004G8EKIA	I did not go wrong when I purchased this stereo receiver. tons of power pushing my system, what an upgrade from my old one, this is a real powerhouse. It pounds. Remote control, quality crafted stereo receiver for under a hundred bucks! I thought it would be good, but did not expect this. A sweet deal!	If you want just a stereo then this will do the manual is very limited. The fan is loud and the USB player will only let you go one track at a time so if you have a 100 tracks it will take time to get there. The sound is fine and is easy to connect up.	First problem I have with this receiver is you can't set the channel presets. Also the speaker wire terminals are NOT clamps and it took me a while to screw them in. The power is good and it looks durable. I don't believe you can play the tv's sound through the receiver.	I got this to replace a 20 year old stereo I had. I went by the speaker specifications when I purchased this one. When I hooked it up, this receiver pushed my 15's more than I ever heard before without messing them up. Perfection!! I recommend this to everyone!	This Amp is very inexpensive and its performance proves its quality. First, you can't play a turntable without buying a preamp. That would be ok if the sound reproduction was good. I would have settled for good. I didn't settle and returned it; you shouldn't either.	Amazon ought to be ashamed to carry this junk on their line-up. You got enough BAD reviews to open your eyes.Just reading the murdered English in their manual is enough to tell you this is made by prisoners. Just try totune to your station on the FM - hopeless. The noisy constant fan! The unreal low price should have been a warning.Shame! Charles	This sound system is worth all the money you pay for it iv never heard bass so clear and ass loud as its going tough my 12 '' and 8 '' and two 5 '' subwoofers buy this if your looking for grate sound.	The Stereo works fantastic as Amp. for laptop Or MP3 player. Radio reception is poor. Has great range of sound adjustment. I have it in my garage, with speakers all around. Use mostly for Sirius / XM radio on laptop.	You get what you pay for with this receiver. Terrible radio reception, very noisy fan, and don't expect any help from the useless manual. It does have decent power, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a quality product.	This is an inexpensive stereo option. The manual is limited and is difficult to read, also the fan is loud. The radio reception is poor quality. The sound quality though is great, when listening to Sirius or when hooked up to a laptop.	This sound system is worth the cost. The bass is so clear and loud, the stereo works fantastic and the range of sound adjustment is great. I had a problem setting the channel preset. Overall, it's a sweet deal.
electronics	B005MZO5TA	Exactly as described, at 8 + oz. of solid metal this grip offers a stable way to hold your lightweight digital camera, without putting you fingers in front of the lens or flash. I find it works well with the Kodak PlaySmart Video camera and the Nikon S9100 point and shoot.Opteka HG-5 Pistol Handgrip Stabilizer for Point-n-Shoot, DSLR and Video Cameras	Probably the best and the least expensive stick I've ever owned and I love it.I use this with my GoPro HD Hero2. It's a bit heavy but the construct is very good. You can use this as a weapon too. lol	Bought this as part of the stabilizer rig then realized that this was easier to use alone than the rig itself. I am going to use it with a camera with an active stabilizer. Videos looked good. Will update after I use it this weekend. It looks good and is built solid.	I use this with a dual-camera mount and I like this because of the heft / weight and it stays pretty secure whether I use it with the mount or on my flip video camera or snapshot. I'd recommend this handle highly.	I was planning to use this with my D7000 + Battery Grip + 80-200 f / 2.8 lens, but when I received it, I changed my mind.It just does not look like it can handle that load. I put it on my Panasonic GF2, and it performs very nicely.Would highly recommend it for lighter cameras.	The unit is quite sturdy. I bought it to replace the pistol grip unit also featured because the pistol grip locking mechanism did seem to want to lock tight. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. A great purchase for the money.	This is the 2nd stabilizer that I've purchased... one for my Sony a99 and one for my Sony a33. I can't speak highly enough about this handy little item! It's perfectly sized and the ergonomics is ideal! Two thumbs up!!	A low cost device that I bought and paired with a cell phone reduce jittery videos. Works pretty well for handheld use even when walking. The thread seemed a little recessed at first until I moved the washer flat. I recommend this product for anyone who records videos often for friends, and family especially with your cell phone.	Exactly as described. Looks good with a solid build and the unit is quite sturdy. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. It is a great purchase for the money. I'd recommend this handle highly.	This stabilizer is perfect for light weight cameras and can also be used with a cell phone to help diminish jitter. You can feel the heft in this stabilizer and know that it will stay secure. It feels weighty and professional. I would say to use caution when using it with larger cameras but it is perfect for smaller cameras. Overall, it is recommended.	A great all-around, sturdy stick for cameras. It is very versatile and quite ideal for lightweight cameras especially, and this stick is highly recommended for its great price-point and overall versatility.
electronics	B00BOZCSQE	of the fact that an SD card is NOT included with this camera. It is essential (you can only take 2 pix with the camera's internal memory) and it is standard practice to include one with a camera. So add c. $25 to any advertised price that you see here. Camera itself is fine.	Sharp pictures. Impressed with the low light capability. Almost as close as my DSLR. Ample shot configuration via auto presets as well as some options. Would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. Adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. Sturdy and slips easily into pocket.	I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BASED ON CONSUMER REPORTS REVIEW. IT HAS MET MOST OF THE REQUIERMENTS. ITS PICTURE QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THE CANNON 110 HS THAT IT IS REPLACING. I HAD TO GLUE A RISER ON THE ON / OFF BUTTON SINCE IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY THUMB	Have only used the camera a short time but am really impressed with all the features and marvel at the detail of almost any type photo situation. The low light feature is outstanding and will be very helpful in museums and other venues where flash is not allowed. Overall I love this camera.	i have high-bride, mirrorless camera which is over 700bucks, but this camera, nikon one is almost as good as my fancy mirrorless camera.. i just love it! light, easy to carry around and pictures are just great. satisfied.	Love this camera for quality picture taking and size. Very easy to use and takes professional photos. I like to take my camera everywhere and this is the perfect size. It's a great first camera to explore with before investing in a DSLR.	After looking in the Consumer Reports for a new camera I came along this one. It was number one on the list.It was a good price so I bought it. It takes a little time to learn about the choices and setting up but then it's easy to use. I love my camera.	The battery is constantly malfunctioning making the camera unusable. I was on a once-in-a-lifetime trip in Malaysia in August and this happened constantly. The on / off button is also malfinctioning, besides that is very poorly designed. What good are all kinds of features when their usability is way below par!?	This camera is easy to use and you can take it anywhere. The picture quality is generally great. Some things to note are that it does not include an SD card and there have been instances of issues regarding the on / off button, they can seem a little small. It also holds it's own against more expensive cameras. Overall this small but easy to use camera takes great pictures so it is recommended with confidence.	I like this camera for its picture taking and size. Takes professional photos and it is very easy to use. It's low light feature is outstanding and helpful in venues that flashes are not allowed. I love this camera.	If you are a beginning photographer and wan good pictures i suggest buying this Nikon camera. it does not come with an sd card which is not cool for the money i spent and they can be pretty pricey. If you need low light capability on your camera , than this is the one for you it seems to have a feature for every scene or situation
electronics	B00DB94FB2	The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted	you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it.	Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!	The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present	I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a $5 adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!	As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product.	My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT! Its so easy to operate by setting the alarm.. I like the way when you put your iphone 4s to the dock its charge at the same time while you are you using it...! Great product	While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.	This FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!	This is a great product. It has amazing sound quality, and the dual-band feature is nice. I love the fact that it charges my device while it's docked. Not only is this thing functional, but it also looks great and doesn't take up a lot of space. Overall, I would advise buying this if your needs call for an awesome speaker that doubles as a charging station.	This is exactly what I've been looking for! It has great sound quality and it's really easy to dock my iPhone in it (it charges my phone at the same time! Bonus) The alarm is easy to use and does it's job. Some iPhones and iPods will need an adapter, so make sure to check that out first.
health_personal_care	B00028QA72	I wanted to get rid of deodorants after reading about the hazards of the ingredients used in them. These crystals do the job. No they do not keep you from sweating. But, they do take care of the odor. Use as directed... after showering and such. I have not bought deodorant in years. These rocks last a long, long time...	This does indeed work and if you are not a heavy perspirer it will be effective for several days. Don't know for sure how long it will last as I've not had mine that long, but for sure it's cheaper than the stuff we've been using for years.	This stuff WORKS. It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn't surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces. I'll buy the stick next time.	I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants. I am very pleased with the results! This works better than any deodorant I have ever used. I will never go back to traditional deodorants. This was money well spent.	I was somewhat skeptical at first in hearing about this product, but now I'm a believer. I purchased a crystal a year ago and it is still working. A little water activates the rock and then you apply it like a regular stick deodorant. I can't believe it works so well and lasts so long.	The product is fantastic, I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers with excessive persperation issues or B.O. It will eliminate both after a few days use. No kidding. However don't buy from this seller, mine arrived broken completely in half and I contacted the seller for a replacement and they would not return my calls.	I love this product! I use it and it doesn't make me smell like cologne or perfume but it keeps me smelling good (like me!) all day. It does not irritate my skin and it does the job. It also lasts so much longer than the stick deodorant I used to use. Better product for less money! A real find!	I have been using this product for over 10 years. It works much better than common over the counter deodorants and lasts much longer. I have never had a odor issue using this product no matter how hot or sweaty I got. Great stuff... the larger 5 oz purchase is the most economical.Highly recomend.	this product is good alternative to deodorants. Crystal lasts a long time. the major drawback is that it is somewhat easy to drop the product and it shatters very easily. overall the product withstood the test of time	This stuff works, fantastic product. I used to doubt it at first when I heard about it, but now I believe in this product. It is still working after purchase about a year ago. It's cheap, keeps me smelling good and doesn't irritate my skin. It can be difficult to hold on to and slippery, but It is money well spent. I highly recommend it.	Economically priced with long lasting results and truth that a little goes a long way, this crystal rock deodorant is a great deal.  Users are pleased with the crystals ability to eliminate body odor even for heavy perspirers. Recommended for those who want to get away from the traditional stick, though be careful for if dropped it will shatter so also may be best purchased in-store versus ordering online.
health_personal_care	B000N245Y2	I'd like to give it a review but no power adapter with cord and so on was included. I got a plug adapter for international use, but nothing to power the unit. I have no idea how good it is and am returning it.	Don't let the 1980's packaging fool you, this is an amazing little machine. The sound is robust, and the ability to dial in the mixture of rain and water effects is outstanding.Now... when will they release an App so I can use it on my phone at the office...	We've used Marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this Travel machine didn't make the grade. Sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. This was $50 +. We returned it to Amazon.	This product does not drown out sound but is a sleep conditioner. It was purchased for my grandaughter who is going on a mission trip to Africa (it takes batteries) and to college in NC. It is a perfect traveling size.	This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made.	We have a full-size analog model of the Marpac Sleep Mate sound conditioner, and have used it for years at home, but it's too bulky to pack. This model is compact, and sounds pretty much like the original. There is no repeating 'loop' of sound to drive you crazy.	We've had this for about two months and use it in our baby's nursery. I like it so far. The sound fills the room well. There aren't a bunch of options in sound, but that doesn't matter at all to me. The unit is small and does the job well. I'd recommend it.	My husband and I use a white noise machine in our condo, and love it. When we traveled, we never felt we slept as well without that background noise. We have tried the free Apps on our phones, but they are not as good as this.	a good product, compares to the original very good, for the fraction of the size. very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm, since the space is an issue there. there was no power cord, so that should be kept in mind. much better than nose generating apps.	This sound machine is small, battery powered, and compact.  It does not come with a power adapter, so be prepared with batteries wherever you plan to use it.  There is only one sound programmed into the machine – a sound mixture of rain and water.  This is great to aid sleep, relaxation in the office, or nurseries.	This sound machine is the perfect size for traveling. It is quite compact, and it can be powered with the adapter or batteries. It offers a small variety of rain and other water effects, and will be loud enough for most people. If you have a larger room or a super noisy environment, the volume might not be high enough for you.
health_personal_care	B003HT9W32	I bought this monitor as a newcomer to heart rate monitors. It is easy to use right out of the box and makes working out more enjoyable - you can make sure that you are working hard enough to improve, but not too hard. Very good value.	It's my first heart rate monitor. Very useful. I always run with it to control my pace. The problem is when I run more then 1 hour because I don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display.	Extremely easy to use, only one button. Seems to be fairly accurate. Has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. However, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily.	I was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. But after checking the manual on the internet I was able to set it up and use it. It is much easier than others I have purchased. This is what I was looking for. Ease of use.	This is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. Beginner or non-competitive runners should stick to basic types like this. The Polar monitors I have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. I am coming off a long layoff and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking overtraining.	If you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. There aren't any bells and whistles at all. Straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. The log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session.	This was very well-rated on consumer reports. I really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. The display is easy to read and it's light-weight.	I ordered and Polar FT2 and it was confirmed after the order was processed. When I got the email for confirmation, it said FT1. They did the old bait and switch on me! I immediately returned it and very upset with the order after going through a long process of doing research for a HRM. Very dissatisfied!	very good heart monitor if you don't need advanced features, that would be used mainly by professionals.  very easy use. the drawbacks are, bad or no included manual, but manual is accessible on the internet. and only four digits on the display, so if you run more than an hour that could be an issue. overall recommended	This heart rate monitor is very user friendly for beginners.  Very easy to use straight out of the box. However, this product comes with an instruction booklet and internet instructions if you need help with initial set up. You can program your target heart rate and there is an audible beep when you are in or fall out of target range. Very easy to read display which can also has a backlight. The only drawback is the log will only store the last workout data.  Overall a very nice beginner heart rate monitor.	This is a good monitor, it is easy to use and well-made. The product is for you, if you are in need of a heart rate monitor. It is fairly accurate and warns you should in case you fall out of a target heart range. The battery is not replaceable and screen easily scratches.
health_personal_care	B004OQQLTU	Regretfully the package arrived in a plastic bag with a note on it telling us that the Post Office cares. The bottle had been completely crushed in bag it was sent in, so we never got to use it.The bag of liquid did smell great though!!!	I tried this on both a cotton t-shirt, and a polyester dress shirt, and it worked quite well, and very quick; almost effortless. Just spray it on, and smooth it with your fingers.The product says it can be used in the place of starch, but my wife tried it when ironing, and it didn't help at all.	i WOULD NOT RISK BUYING THIS ITEM. WAS DELIVERED TODAY. THE PACKAGE WAS COMPLETELY SOAKED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN ANY SPRAY BOTTLE. I WILL BE ASKING FOR FULL REFUND.Amazon gave me a full credit when I chatted with them. I can't review since I didn't get any to try.	I really do not like to iron. I still have a scar from my last attempt. I love this product. I just spray onto my cotton shirt and smooth, then allow to dry about 30-60 minutes. There is an obvious reduction in wrinkles. No, it is not perfect, but it is presentable.	My wife and I tried this on a few items but it didn't work that great. I still have a lot of the bottle left so I'll keep on trying, but if we want it done right we still turn to the iron first. I do, however, really like how it takes away the static electricity buildup.	I love this stuff. It works on every types of clothing from jeans to tshirts and dress shirts. Spray a little on an work the wrinkle out with your hand! Just don't overspray. We take this on vacation so we don't have to waster our time ironing!	Woohoo what a great product. A few sprays and the wrinkles disappear from your teeshirts and dress shirts. It has a little trouble with clothing like dress pants and also it didn't work on removing wrinkles from my curtains. That said, this baby has saved me hours of ironing, and I'm super happy with this purchase.	This is a wonderful wrinkle release product. Just spray it on your fabric, any fabric smooth the product in with hands smoothing out wrinkles and let dry. Goodbye iron. I will definitely take it on my next vacation. It removes wrinkles and makes clothes smell fresh, I love it.	While it's not full proof, this spray is great at reducing the number of wrinkles in cotton and polyester materials. It's less effective on thicker materials. It's quick and easy to use, and it has a nice scent. It's a good thing to bring on vacation to freshen up packed clothes. Just be aware, the bottle is prone to leaking!	This is an awesome wrinkle release product, with a nice aroma. When applied, wrinkles disappear from your clothes. The package arrived in a bad condition, it's not perfect, but quite presentable. I love it.	When my bottle arrived, it had leaked a bit in the bag, but I still had about 3/4 to use. It smells amazing! I have always really hated ironing, so it's a good substitute for that, but only on my shirts. Any work pants that have wrinkles, I still have to turn on the iron. However, it really seems to reduce static when ironing, so it's still handy that way! Overall it's not as great as advertised, but it's still pretty useful. Order with caution though, leakage seems to be a common occurrence.
health_personal_care	B005H86LZ8	What else can be said..... this product is revolutionary. I cannot believe something so simple could be so effective and I wonder why I didn't see this myself! Kudos to the inventor. This magnet is strong and putting your glasses through the space while working is easy and just as easy to retrieve them when needed. Necessity is the mother of invention....	I saw this product on SHARK TANK and wanted it then. When I ordered it and tried it I was very impressed. The magnet is super strong and you can place it anywhere on your clothing. I bought 2 and will order more for Christmas gifts.Ellen	I wish I could use this, but my cardilogist said no.... even though I have a fairly new, high-fangled pacemaker. He doesn't have any problem with me having a cell phone in my shirt pocket, but said this magnet is just too powerful.	These little guys are amazing,, the magnetic is very strong,, your glasses will not fall out when bending over.. yeah maybe a crystal does fall out so what,, just glue it back in and it stays,, you'll always know where your glasses are,, love mine	I like it, keeps the glasses handy but when you bend over, they can fall out. So good idea, but has its limits. Perhaps if it didn't stick out as far, that would hold the glasses tighter.	ReadeRest Eye-Glass Holder-Magnet broke off after one week and I have no phone number to call the company. For the week I had it, it worked fine on my shirt but one of the front round magnets separted from the glass holding piece. A piece of junk!	Fantastic product! Ive had to order more now that ive shown to everyone. They all want one. Can be placed anywhere on your clothing and blends right in. Had people think it was part of the clothing. great gift / stocking stuffer	Great Product! Very Strong Magnet that works in holding and keeping your glasses secure. Well worth the price that I paid for it... First showing of this product was on 'Shark Tank' and it has lived up to expectations!	This product is innovative and works! It keeps your glasses with you and the strong magnet lasts. Everyone that I've shown this to decides that they need one too. The only problems are that the small pieces can occasionally fall off, and the glasses don't always stay if you bend over. Otherwise, this is a great product that is especially useful if you tend to misplace your glasses.	This lived up to expectations after the product was featured on Shark Tank. The magnet is very strong, and will work anywhere on clothing. Glasses won't slip or fall. However, those with pacemakers should avoid due to the strong magnet. Overall, recommend.	These magnetic eyeware retainers attach firmly to your clothes and keep your glasses within reach when you're not wearing them. Though they normally keep a strong grip, it is possible in some circumstances for your glasses to fall out. Also, I am unsure if the product will last very long.
health_personal_care	B005JS7KME	Got these for my 9-year-old who has really bad foot odor. I really had little confidence that these would work but needed to try something- ANYTHING- to help. And lo and behold they actually work. So well that I ordered another set for a second pair of shoes.	I love this product... 100% natural AND eliminates foot odor! While it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. Very impressed! It has worked wonders so far! Can't wait to put this product to test this summer!	I have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. I had tried everything to get rid of it. The final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. FINALLY, normal soft feet!	The insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. I love that they are discreet and thin. I no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. I definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles.	Product is OK. It doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. It does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. I wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost less.Ok	Im sure if I were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. I am wearing them in my croc I have to wear for work. Thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around.	This is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! They are so effective I use them in several pairs of shoes. I'm a very happy customer, thanks so much Zederna!	These insoles are so thin that I can even wear them in my pumps. They look SO much nicer than odor-eaters and work way better too. I highly recommend them. I accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. It was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. Enjoy!	This is an excellent product! Just as advertised, it eliminates foot odor and on top of that the insole is so thin it can be used in multiple types of shoes including heels. Very comfortable and well worth the price to have soft odor free feet after wearing shoes!	While they are a little thin which can be an issue, the Insoles work really well at keeping odor away and fits really well in most shoes. While cheaper ones do exist on the market, these ones have been great at battling the issues i had before using these insoles.	These odor-absorbing insoles work very well! The thin insoles fit well into many kinds of footwear and they are also easy to trim down if they are too large. They help to absorb odor and wetness all day. , and may even extend the life of my shoes.
health_personal_care	B008Z8W714	I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I am pleasantly pleased. The unit fits perfectly into my Zippo case, and is easy to fill and use. Once in a while it won't light but if you blow into the flame area it will work the next try.	I think Zippo over charges and I wanted to try off brand. I must say I have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me. Don't get me wrong I love classic Zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for EDC since they have almost zero odor. The torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference.	got for a christmas gift and i cant say how awsome this insert is i love that the fuel wont just evaporate the flames a bit big at first and had to urn screw as how the little lever wouldnt go over far enough but again no biggy awsome product i challenge you to blow this thing out	i bought this product expecting it to last about a week, that was almost a year ago. i want to share just the facts: it plastic so don't go beating it aroundits a little small so some tape is needed to build it up and hold it in placeif you clean it right it will last for a long time	I like carrying my classic Zippo and not tainting my cigars with lighter fluid. Much cheaper to get a Zippo and this insert than to buy a Zippo Blu. I also prefer the electric ignition to the flint wheel on the Zippo Blu.	I love the old style Zippo but was having difficulty with the standard fluid and carrying the lighter around in my pocket. This made it very convenient and it's a cool 'novelty' item. I still keep most of my Zippos original (standard insert), but it's cool to have a few of these with the 'butane' conversion kit...	It did not fit properly. I then removed it and re-inserted original Zippo insert. To my dismay, cap of Zippo no longer closed properly. (Apparently, attempting to get the Thunderbird insert into the Zippo and close the cap caused the hinge to deform, rendering the Zippo unusable). Disappointing, to say the least!	Thank God I found this. It works on Butane, and it will hold fuel longer than a week. Stupid Zippo, with their flints, and their packing, and their wicks. They make a version of this with a flint, do not buy that one, buy this one. It works great. Stay away form Z-plus.	Great insert for the price, works well with my Zippo case. It uses butane, which is cleaner burning as well as convenient. Thunderbird is a fantastic alternative to the more pricey Zippo inserts. It holds a big flame, too, and it's easily adjustable.	This butane conversion allows for the case of a classic Zippo to clean burning butane lighter.  It allows for flame height adjustments and holds its flame well.  It is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use. While this is not a licensed Zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed.	When I ordered this, I didn't know what to expect. I'm pleasantly surprised. It's plastic, but very convenient and the unit fits very well into my Zippo case. You can fine tune your preference as the torch adjusts very nicely. It works great. I also had issues with closing the cap of Zippo.
health_personal_care	B00GW5NX88	Immediately curbed my RLS. Feels great to get some sleep! Also has produced a noticeable improvement in my girlfriends mood over the last week. Cant recommend this stuff enough. Many people are deficient in Magnesium these days which can cause a whole host of problems. This pure product is definetly the most affordable and effective way to supplement magnesium daily.	It is a very good dissolving powder, i noticed that I feel much more calm and rested since using a teaspoon a day for the last 2 days... I cant give it 5 stars because of the short time Ive been taking it, but I will update this review in about a week.	I use this in conjunction with N-Acetyl L-Cysteine and TUDCA for the liver, but it has been GREAT for my arthritis! I definitely will continue to use this product. I currently take 3327 mg x d, so it is reasonably priced. Again, great product!	I purchased this to put in my Soylent mix, and I couldn't be happier. Like other supplements I've ordered from this company, the product is well shipped and the resealable bag is easy to store. I also like how concentrated it is, and how little I need to use to supplement my diet.Couldn't be happier.	I have been taking Magnesium supplements for a number of years. Magnesium Citrate seems to work best for me, and I like being able to customize my own dosage. No fillers, and no artificial flavoring, excellent packaging, and a quality product.	I am not pleased with this product. I ordered this because it was the same ingredient in a similar product, 'CALM' magnesium citrate powder. However, this product is not what I expected. It does not taste or fizz like the CALM powder. This was an attempt to order in bulk and save money, but I failed with this one.	I like this product, but not sure how it's as strong as it says it is. I have noticed that I have better results from the Calms magnesium than taking double the dose of this product. I don't get the upset stomach from this like what's common for a citrate form, so maybe it's being absorbed better.	The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder dissolves easily in liquid and works especially great in my natural smoothies that I mix in a blender, and can also work great with juices. A much better deal than magnesium citrate in liquid solution form, especially the 1Kg bag.	this magnesium supplement is very good for the money. helps to improve the mood, to make sleep better. the price is a better deal than the competitor products. especially if you buy in bulk. one thing, it does not taste like a CALM product, so you should keep that in mind. recommended.	This product has been helpful for my everyday aches and pains. I found that I can easily mix it into my morning smoothies, juice or even plain almond milk without any weird taste or fizzing. The product came very well packaged and I love the resealable bag for easy storage.All in all a great product.	The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder is a unique product in its own right. as it does dissolve well, it has a lot of health benefits such as calming down , arthritis. as it comes in a liuid form i prefer the powder for some weird reason. With it being so affordable, ordering this in a large amount is preferred for me and lastly with it being so  concentrated it can last for a long time
home_kitchen	B00006IUVM	I had an almost identical steamer from Black & Decker purchased around 1985. The lid on that one finally broke and I've been looking for one like it for 2 years. Nice to see a good design hasn't been changed. Love the steamer!	I bought this one as a replacement for an old one I had. We cook with it every day and love it! It is the perfect size for our family. Although the picture shows it with a clear lid, the one I received in the mail had a white lid.	I love this steamer. Everyone in my family now has one because they are so great. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up boiled-over rice from the stove! It also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free.	THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THESE STEAMERS. I USED THE FIRST ONE ALMOST DAILY FOR OVER 5 YEARS. I LOVE THE VERSITILITY OF THIS ITEM. MAKES EXCELLENT STEAMED SHRIMP, THE RICE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, VEGETABLES TASTE GREAT. JUST A USEFUL ITEM TO HAVE IN THE KITCHEN.	I love this steamer. I use it to steam all kinds of vegetables and new potatoes. I really like the larger basket and the screen where you can put herbs or spices to flavor what you are cooking. I highly recommend it.	Sometimes I use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when I want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. I've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. The instruction book in helpful too. Thank you.	boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) I would definately recommend this product. The only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have NO couter space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it.	This is our second B / D steamer. The first served us well for years before the plexiglass bowl cracked and finally broke. It was impossible to find a replacement in any major chain stores. Lots of rice steamers but no small in size vegetable steamers. Amazon came through again. Thanks Jeff!	This kitchen steamer is based on a classic design, works very well and is convenient to use. It can steam a variety of foods, from vegetables and starches, to seafood and eggs. It's rather large, which can be an issue if your counter space is limited. Overall, highly recommended.	This steamer is an excellent product. It does wonderful when cooking rice, boiling eggs, steaming vegetables and more! It makes clean up a breeze and even has a handy screen for putting seasoning in what your cooking. Definitley a nice addition to any kitchen!	This is a very nice and roomy steamer.  It has plenty of space to steam multiple items or even just one.  It is on the larger side so it is hard to store when not in use.  All the food that is steamed in it comes out perfect and clean up is easy.  i would recommend this to anyone.
home_kitchen	B0002U34HY	We've used these filters in our DustBuster for several years. With a little care, such as occasionally blowing it out with air or tapping on sidewalk, they have very long life. Seem to catch everything from grit, to dog hair, to fine ashes without letting much blow through exhaust. Getting harder to find at local stores, so I bought two.	This is the wrong filter if you are buying the CHV1510 Hand Vacuum. Amazon pairs it up together and it SAYS it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs,' but it doesn't. You need the VF110 for the CHV1510. Amazon WRONG. Product Description WRONG. Me wrong for not reading the reviews first.	Instead of having to buy an all new Dustbuster just because mine is older and the filters aren't in stock anywhere didn't mean I had to updrage & pay for a newer one. After having found the filters here, I buy them and they work extremely well. Very satisfied.	I bought this to replace my tired and dirty filter. After I received it, I realized that there was nothing wrong with the one I already had. (They are washable.) However it helps to have two, so you can change the filter quickly when necessary and not take time to wash the first one.	This item list listed with the vacuum -- 'frequently bought together' with the Black & Decker CHV9608 9.6 Volt Cyclonic-Action Cordless DustBuster BUT this filter does NOT fit! Argh! Corrections are needed in the 'frequently bought together' section, and the correct filter needs to be listed.	I bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum I got. Recently, I went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. To boot, I missed the window to get a refund. Rip off!	I bought the cordless Cyclonic DustBuster CHV1408. The correct filter for the DustBuster CHV1408 is Replacement Filter VF08. In the 'Frequently Bought Together' section at Amazon, both the VF100 replacement filter and the VF08 replacement filter are listed. The VF100 replacement filter WILL NOT fit the CHV1408.	I was disappointed to discover that the filter does not fit the Black and Decker Dustbuster I own. There are nubs around the top that prevent it from working. I have not been able by number or description to locate the proper filter or Amazon or anywhere else. This is very disappointing as I purchased the vacuum on Amazon.	Buying a new dustbuster is unnecessary when in reality just cleaning or replacing the filters will do the job just fine. Amazon also provides added risk by recommending dustbusters that don't fit with certain filters.	I bought these because I know that these filters are the ones I need. I've bought them before, but Amazon repeatedly tells me that I need a different filter. I think their Bought Together section is messed up, so don't buy this filter just because Amazon says to. Anyways, these filters have always worked well for me.	"Before purchasing this product, I highly suggest checking your vaccumn to see what type of filters will fit. Amazon lists this product with several cyclone vaccumns under the ""commonly purchased together"" section and that is not correct. This filter wilk not work in just any cyclone vaccumn. If this fliter actually fits in your vaccumn, its a great product and will last a long time if you take care of it and rinse it off occassionally."
home_kitchen	B000COQT0Y	I spent an hour looking for a solar system poster that included Pluto. My son insists it is unfair that Pluto was 'fired'. It includes information on conditions, atmosphere, diameter, and the duration of each planets 'day' and 'year'. It covered all the basic information we needed, and it is beautiful.	Pretty happy with the poster for something to teach my son when he grows up about just how small our world actually is compared to the other planets that are out there.Overall good quality and looks pretty good up on the wall.Big enough to catch someones eye and clear enough to tell which planet is which.	This poster is a few years out of date - still lists Pluto as a planet - but man, the artwork on it is awesome. I also love the inset map that shows the planets' sizes to scale. It's probably not good for a classroom due to its age, but for a bedroom or general decoration, it's great.	My son said 'Wow, this is great!' He's only 4 years but he's enjoying learning about the solar system. Each planet has an informative summary. Great service! Will be framing the poster for his room. Love it!!	Its a great poster! Bought at a huge discount. Only thing is I thought the description said laminated. It was not, its a standard poster. But its perfect for what I needed it for. Now I just have to get a frame for it: D	I could not have been more disappointed in my purchase! The picture and size was perfect but there were so many wrinkles it looked terrible. I took it to a professional framer and even using there equipment the wrinkles remained. When I bought the poster it was supposed to be brand new. I was really ripped off and may never order from Amazon again.	It's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. The poster is nice though. We didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot!	The item arrived on time and my son loves it. It's posted on the side wall next to his bed. He looks at it all the time. The picture quality is not perfect but for the price it's okay.	The picture size is perfect, and the quality is great. It's a wonderful tool for teaching a child about the solar system. There is an educational summary for every planet. However, it is slightly dated since Pluto is still included, but you can just tell your child Pluto retired from its position as a planet. It's also not laminated, but we put it in a frame and it looks really nice on the wall.	This poster is great for teaching children about the solar system. It is informative and easy to understand. It does not come with a frame. The quality is not the best and may be difficult to read from far away. Overall, I recommend the poster despite the quality because the price is very low.	The poster is a little outdated because it still lists Pluto as a planet, but it is a beautiful poster. There are some concerns regarding the quality of the shipping as there was the issue of it not being laminated and also having wrinkles.
home_kitchen	B001EQJ5AU	It was easy to put together and looks great. However, when the item was shipped to me, one of the backs of the chairs was broken. I just fixed it myself with wood glue. Its not even visible now. The rest of it was in perfect condition.	The table and chairs are very nice but not quite the color I expected (but I am getting used to it). Table and chairs delivered by the carrier right on time and with no damage. Very easy to assemble, but very difficult to get out of the box it was so well protected.	This table was super easy to put together. The table and chairs are solid and sturdy! The seats are very comfortable. The table is the perfect size for our not so big kitchen. We are very pleased with this purchase.	Moved to smaller living quarters and this just fits the bill. Color is perfect and it was easy to assemble. One fault to find is that the top scratches easily. It even came with a scratch. Other than that it is fine.	I love my new dining room set. The set is very sturdy, the walnut finish is a nice color.This set is great for a small area, kitchen nook.Would not recommend for a large eating area.Table is small and so are the chairs.Yet strong enough to hold big boys and girls, thumps up, great price, packed well, arrived in a timely matter.	It fits perfectly in the kitchen at the office. My staff assembled it without any delay. Everyone loves the dining set and they can't believe I ordered it on-line. I made the measurements and made sure of the dimensions of the room and the dining set and it's a perfect fit.	I received this table and chairs completely damaged. The customer service experience with this company was terrible. In my opinion, this set is cheap and overpriced. It's not durable and not worth the money. Don't waste your time.	The box looked like it had been opened, and then re-taped for resell. One of the chairs was broken, and the broken piece was nowhere close to the originating piece. Possibly other pieces damaged too, though didn't bother looking, instead just re-taped it back up to be sent back. I hope they don't just resell it to someone else.	Good deal on these tables and chairs! May come in separate packages but they will be well protected. Color may vary from what you see on the website so be aware. Easy assembly. Seems durable enough. Great option for a small living space.	The dinning room set is very sturdy, seats are very comfortable and has a nice color. Great for small area, but I will not advice usage for a large eating area. It looks great and it is easy to put together. The top scratches easily. It was delivered on time and I'm pleased with the purchase.	the product is very easy to assemble. the size and colors are nice, fit in a small room. the major drawback of the product is that it often comes damaged, probably when shipping. Scratches, broken parts, even completely unusable sets are common.
home_kitchen	B001GCV0FK	This teapot works well for me, sometimes I wish it had a whistle. The color appears as shown. Remember to use it on low / medium heat. At first the top is a little difficult to remove but now it works well.	As a tea pot it works fine but the handle is plastic & the cover has repainted & chipped paint at the base of the knob.I am not happy with the product but because of my health & price, I did not send it back.	It's lovely. NO cracking or loss of enamel. It is just the right color. Sadly it is a little smaller than I expected (smaller than the average tea kettle) makes for small batches of tea. Quite happy with it though.	Be warned - the color of this cute little kettle as depicted in this ad is not at all what arrives when you order it. It's more of a medium, dusty sky blue. Not in any way 'turquoise.'	The color is great. Just what I wanted for my kitchen Devore. One thing, I rated 4 stars because I find it difficult to open the lid... it's really tough. It's tight. After a few day it has gotten better. I think it'll keep getting easier. Besides that one flaw I like it.	The kettle is beautiful, but within 5 uses the handle started melting. Apparently the handle is plastic and cannot withstand hot temperatures, which is unfortunate for a product that must hold boiling water. You can buy this kettle if you don't plan on using it. You've been warned!!	Perfect for our seafront condo in Florida style - bought all our kitchen accessories to go with it.No problems, but I do intend to drain all the water out after using and not let any sit overnight in the pot to prevent rust.	I ordered this as a gift because the color is shown as a light turquoise, which I wanted. The color is actually a very dark turquoise, could have bought the same color in Target for less money... the teapot itself is very nice.. may be sending it back though	This is a beautiful kettle even though it appears smaller and the color is a little off from the ads and it may seem a bit smaller  but otherwise it looks very nice. Something to keep in mind of though is the handle seems unable to handle too much heat as it is can melt easier than you'd think.	The color is great. It works fine as a teapot, but the handle is plastic, so it can't withstand high temperatures. I had difficulty removing the lid, but got better after some days. I'm quite happy with it though.	This teapot is cheaply made with a plastic handle, it's not true to color (dark blue instead of turquoise). The lid is really tight, adding to the frustration. Save yourself a return and look elsewhere for a better product.
home_kitchen	B00455NTOU	It worked great for 6 months and suddenly stopped working. CucinaPro customer care was pretty useful in replacing the defective one with brand new one within a week. Thanks for a great customer service!!! Hopefully, this one won't go bad in next 6 months.	The machine is very tricky. It requires some trial and errors to make it work right. I do not like to put oil in the dough; however, it appears to me that without oil it is impossible to make tortilla or chapatti. It is useless for me.	I love this tortilla maker. I hate to buy them from the store and they sit in my fridge. This way I make them on the night we eat them. Yes you should grill them after to get the toasted look.	Great machine!!! I use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time. I also make pizza crusts, pancakes and crepes. You have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy. Love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch.	For this price, plus the pennys you'll spend on a 3-4 ingredient mix, this appliance pays for itself in about 2 months at our house. Tortillas taste so fresh, no yucky preservatives, and you'll save TONS not buying anymore bleached white over-priced tortillas at the grocery store.	I noticed that several reviews indicated that users were using this machine to both press and cook their tortillas. This machine works in the same way as the 3000 dollar tortilla press except no automatic operation, that said a tortilla press needs to be hot to keep the tortilla from shrinking, however the tortilla needs to be finished cooking on a griddle for best results.	Fun and easy to use! Took me one batch to get my technique worked out, but it was very simple, easy to follow directions. Easy clean up too! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric tortilla maker!	I bought this for my boyfriend for making Roti but it flattens too much and so you don't get the air pockets and flakiness that you want in roti. Probably great and easy for tortillas but we just don't eat them.	Great value machine.  After a few trial runs, you can make the perfect tortilla.  It can also make an array of other edibles such as crepes and pizza crusts.  It is not so good for dough that requires air pockets as it is a press, but for tortillas, it's great.  Customer service is very responsive and helpful.	The CucinaPro Tortilla maker is worth the money. It's a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you get fresh, homemade tortillas that taste great. It works just like the more expensive presses. Their customer service is fantastic, very helpful. I would recommend this to any home cook.	I love this tortilla maker. It's fun, easy to use and easy to clean up too. The machine performs same function as a 3000 dollar tortilla press but has no automatic operation. This product also have a good customer service as it replaced a defective one within a week.
home_kitchen	B004R9X6VU	Not much air comes out of this thing. What does come out only comes out one side so I can't have it oscillate. I have to turn it so the side that has the air coming out is facing me.Piece of crap..... don't waste your money! Perfect example of 'you get what you pay for'. >: (	This fan takes up very little space and is pretty quiet. Since it's fairly tall, it can blow in your face when you're sitting down. It would be nice to be able to change the degree of oscillation, but that's not a huge deal.	I've had this for two months now, and I've noticed that it feels like there's only air coming out of one side. Bummer. Not sure what could be the problem, but it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend.	It's not that powerful unless you are all of a few inches from it. It wobbles a bit and after a few weeks of use it starts to squeak if you use the oscillating setting. I wish I wouldn't have cheaped out and bought a better more expensive fan.	This fan is pretty noisy in my sons small bedroom but I only really put it on the lowest setting so it's no big deal. What bothers me about it is that the fan blows out to the side of the vents rather than in the middle so I have to really play with it to aim it properly.	This fan is a horrible purchase. It doesn't blow air straight ahead. You have to turn the fan at an angle to feel any wind AND only if on high and within 24 inches. It was such a waste of money, I now have to buy another fan.	This tower fan is the right size, the right color. But the air flows from the side of the vent not from the full vent. You have to turn the fan almost to the wall to get the benefit of the fan. I would not recommend this fan.	My fan arrived with an out of balance blade assembly and had to be returned. The base is too small, which lets the tower sway. I ordered the Holmes HTF3211AR-BU and for a few extra dollars got a fan with a bigger base and remote control. Much better quality.	This fan is a great size as it doesn't take up too much space. However, the airflow doesn't come out from the middle rather it comes out from the sides. Because of this, you have to play with the position to get the benefits of the cooling aspect. I would not recommend this for daily use.	This is a cheap fan that doesn't work well. Air only comes out of one side, instead of out the front, and is very weak. You can't use oscillate if you wan't to feel any blowing air. I don't recommend this fan. Spend a little more money and get one that is much better.	I bought this fan to keep right next to me when I'm working at my desk or reading, and for this purpose, it works great. There's plenty of airflow for a personal fan, but if you are trying to cool a room, this is not a good option. The air only comes out one side for some reason, so I do need to angle it appropriately. It also does not oscillate, but I knew that it didn't have that feature when I ordered it. It's a bit noisy, so probably not ideal for a super quiet office environment.
home_kitchen	B006NNLX2C	Not sure I really like this. Because it's made of silicone, it's very flexible. That means it spills easily. It's also quite small, as other reviewers have pointed out. It's good for making small portions for one or two people.	The item cooks a small serving of vegetables okay but its so floppy to hold onto that I won't buy anymore silicone cookwear / bakewear. My microwave is up over the stove and its too hard to hold onto a floppy item when taking it out and its hot.	I have used this steamer every day since I have gotten it. It steams zucchini perfect in as little as 2 minutes. It makes perfect steamed cauliflower in 3 minutes. I will never tire of how fast it makes my vegetables and the ease of clean up time!!	I love this steamer and am purchasing a second one! It's a great size for a single person to steam veggies or even microwave fish, and the silicone makes it so easy to clean and store. The apple green color is cheerful and I love I can eat from the container (I hate doing dishes LOL).	I liked this steamer when I got it, but it has gotten to be a very unstable item to try and use. I hate taking it out of microwave when hot because I am afraid of it dumping hot food all over me.	I'm glad I tried this steamer. It is so easy to use and the veggie and fish tasted so much better! I think this will help me to stick to my weight loss goal by keeping me full eating more veggies.	As previously reviewed, this steamer is not overly sized. Perfect for single servings / possibly two. Easy to clean. I have a steam setting on my microwave that protests that the lid doesn't fit snuggly enough. Again, you get what you pay for.	I use it all the time for my veggies. It steams my broccoli or green beans in 2.5-3 mins and they are perfect. The container is flimsy and can be hot out of microwave, but rinses off easily and is rest to go again.	The steamer is ideal for making single servings of veggies. I am not able to use this to make large batches at once. It is easy and quick to clean. However, the product is very flimsy and it is easy to spill the food. Overall, I would not recommend this because of the mess that it makes.	This steamer is perfect for someone cooking a single serving for themselves. Anyone cooking for anyone other than themselves, however, will probably not enjoy this product as it is very small and only cooks a small portion at a time. Also, it is made of silicone so the flimsy material causes spills if you are not careful and it is very hot when you pull it out of the microwave.	If you love steamed veggies this is the dream steamer you should have at home. The steamer takes less space in kitchen and very quick to steam all kind of veggies. Very easy to to use and easy to clean. It will steam veggies for a serving for two people at a time.
