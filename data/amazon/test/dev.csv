cloth	B000A2FTN6	These are the perfect tights for my 5-year old. The tights are very well made and have already lasted several washings (hang dry). The color is beautiful, and my daughter loves that she can wear flip-flops to class like the big girls do.	my 3 year old fit into these perfectly. I love these tights, they are great for wearing sandals to dance class and then pulling them over her toes to put ballet slippers on. They are nice and soft and the pink color is pretty. Will purchase again.	These are my daughters preferred ballet tights. They fit well and don't squish her toes as much as some others. The convertible option is nice as she can wear flip flops to the studio with her tights. I like that they appear to be fairly durable.	Bought this for my little one to use for her ballet class. She's almost 4 and this fits perfectly. Transition tights give her the ability to pull up the foot area to around the ankles so that they don't get dirty when not wearing her shoes, but fit well and stay in place when pulled over her feet and used with ballet shoes on.	Great soft fabric, runs small a though. U should consider getting one size up to avoid having your daughter, or son if he's into ballet, have little circulation. Don't get me wrong, great product and material.	I purchased these tights for my 4 year old because she has a tap class immediately followed by an acro class. Tights fit well and were easy to transition to bare feet after tap. I can't comment on how they hold up, as we only had one week of dance so far.	This is my go to tight when my daughter needs new ones. I won't buy anything else. They are super comfy and last forever! She is 7 but very slim and these will fit her for a while but the 8-12 is a better fit for longevity purposes but they only had this size left and I needed them right away.	These are great tights. If your girl is chubby on the waist i think you should order a number up. they are a strong tihgts. My daugther has it for more than 4 months and hasn't broken them. She only complains some days about the waist, just when she has had a lot of milk or food recently. she's 3 years old.	These tights are great. They are durable and do not tear easily, they can be worn and washed without worry. The bottoms of can be pulled up easily so that sandals can be worn with them. It might be a good idea to order a size bigger because they can be a little tight in the waist. Overall, these tights are definitely recommended.	These transition tights are perfect for children sensitive to the tight sensation other tights have around the foot.  The material is soft and durable; they stand up well to both the rough nature of children, and the washing machine.  This product does tend to run slightly small, so purchasing one size up is recommended.	Bought these for my 3 year old daughter for her classes and they turned out great and fit perfectly. She can pull them up to walk in then pull down to cover her toes for class. Strong tights that should last. You might need to buy a size up just for comfort around the waist.
cloth	B002AROW78	My son is 3 and this fits him perfectly. He'll probably be able to wear it for the next two years if he'd like. It's cute too. The hat is thin, but completes the outfit. And the candy pocket is huge. Perfect! I'm so glad we bought this costume over any other Thomas costume.	I ordered this for my 3 yr old for Halloween. He loved it!! The candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. I was very pleased with the way it fit and everything.	Received from Toynk Toys and was very disappointed when I opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric. No 3D sculpted face that I expected. I became creative and added huge googly eyes, pumpkin patch, spiders, bats, and train tracks to the outfit to make it a bit more suitable for my taste.	This is a cute costume that we got for my lil cousin and the candy pouch is basically the size of the entire costume so that's p cool. I doubt it would fit up to six years old like it's advertised as, but it's the perfect size for him (age 2)	My son looked sooooo cute with this costume on. It was well worth the price in my opinion because, his face light up when he seen it in the package. The whole night he kept saying to the doors he got candy from 'me the train, chuchu!!'	I ordered this costume online and it was perfect for my 20 month old son's second Halloween. It was comfortable and he loved the pocket. The size was perfect because it didn't need to be a particular fit. He loved the hat too. Every house we went to trick or treat complimented the outfit too.	My 2 year old loved this costume. He went on the Halloween parade at school and everyone said it was very creative that he has his own candy pouch as part of his costume. He also went around the neighborhood and was pretty popular with his Thomas the train look.	I was pleasantly surprised at how cute this costume is in person. My 3 year old son LOVED being Thomas for Halloween, and the candy catcher was a great feature. It also looks like it will grow with him, so we may use it again for Halloween next year if he's still Thomas-obsessed!	What an impressive Thomas the Train costume! It will fit any train loving toddler for at least a few Halloween seasons due to its roomy design. The candy pocket on the front is an adorable touch. And it's so stinkin' cute! Absolutely worth the price.	This Thomas costume is really cute plus it is comfortable and fits well. My child liked that it has a pocket and a hat. It even has a candy catcher. This costume fits well for a two or three year old. The hat is thin but it is completes the costume. My child loved being Thomas.	This Thomas the Tank Engine Halloween costume looks very cute, and fits well for children around two to five years old. It comes with a large, built-in pouch for hands-free candy hauling. The only potential issue is the fabric seems a bit thin and flimsy. Nonetheless, I would recommend this.
cloth	B004X86A86	I chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. I had to return it, I couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it.	I hate this bag! It's horrible, it's the worst bag I've ever got! It broke the first day I got it and didn't even carry it! It's definitely not the size I thought it was!	I like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. Its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. I would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off.	Love this! pretty size: not to big? not to small, color and shape! and very flashy. Everyone loves it! all the stones were on it when it arrived at my house and only one fell off as i was trying it out!	I have had this purse less than a month and now ALL 3 straps BROKE!!!! Worst quality ever!!!!! Had to throw it away!! 40 $(after shipping) down the toilet!!	i bought this purse and was worried it wouldnt come as it said in the ad. when it arrived at my home i was more than extatic when i saw how nice it was. i am actually very impressed by this purse, and reccomend it to any one looking to spice up there out fit. looks great with boots and leggings!	I was all about this bag and then when ups brought it I was not to happy, the bag is way to small the straps are to short and one of the straps was broken.so I will b e returning or give it to my daughter to play with.	The bag is A LOT smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. However it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it.	This purse is well-designed in terms of appearance, but not in terms of usability and reliability. It is smaller than advertised, the straps are flimsy, and the decorations fall off very easily. It works well if you're just looking for a fashion statement, but if you want something practical, I'd look elsewhere.	Purse looks great. The bag is cute and flashy but the size is smaller than expected overall. The stones and straps are not very durable and break or fall off easily.	This purse is pretty and the material looks great! Unfortunately, it is smaller than I hoped and a few of the straps have fallen off. So have a couple of the stones. I wish it had stayed together because I would have loved to use it more.
cloth	B005085X5Y	I looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. My head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! I have returned it.	Loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. The best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. Provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions.	I needed something for my cruise to Hawaii. I ordered this atthe last moment, but Amazon came through and I receivedit the day before I left. I love the look, the feel, the factthat I can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, I received compliments on it.	I spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. It kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. I have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all.	I wear a hat anytime I am outside for any length of time. This hat is cute and provides great sun protection. I have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to Butterfly World with my granddaughter.	Good quality hat, I love that I can be protected from the sun, and look good too! I'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when I accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. I have already ordered another hat for my daughter.	I bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. They are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. Love the UPF protection. The only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. I think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase.	It looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. I wear it while gardening or for walks. I got it in the Moss Green and the color is as shown online. I'm glad I bought it.	The hat is comfortable, stylish and easy to pack into a suitcase for travel. It protects well from the sun, keeps the head cool, and is suitable for both boat trips and more dressy occasions. Sizing is 'one size fits all' which seems to be good on even large heads. The customer service was great, ensuring the product arrived on time before travelling.	This is a really cute hat that even folds well for easy packing. It is large enough to protect my face and my hair from the sun with UV protection. I received many compliments on this hat. It fits well on stays on nicely at the beach and it made me fee so much cooler on a hot day.	This hat looks great and does the job! The one siz fits all really does fit and the stitching design looks great while protecting your head and neck from the sun's UV rays. It also can be rolled up and packed without messing up the hat as it unrolls and still looks great! Just make sure you hang on to it if your on a boat so it doesn't blow off your head! This is definitely a product you wont want to lose!
cloth	B006QM4HOG	I really appreciate the method of safety built into this bag. But, it is so large that by the time you put all of your stuff in it, it is hard to carry. Certainly could not carry as a cross bag easily. If someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground!	it is light weight and has many compartments. I wish it was just a little larger. There is a 400 item which is too big-rhis is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; I would like to see the company make a 300 series.	I love this bag although I would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. It is light enough that I can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my Kindle. I love this particular shade of blue. It goes well with most everything I wear. I also appreciate the pockets for separating things.	Took this bag on a recent trip to Europe and it was great. No worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. The two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella.	I checked this on two different monitors before I ordered. Both looked more rose color. It's very much a dark purple. Which I'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up	Wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an AMAZING bag. I couldn't believe how much stuff I got in there on a recent trip. Comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. Love this bag.	I used this for the first time last week on a trip to Maine. We normally drive so I was worried about carrying things on the plane. This handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. I love it!	This is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips! Seriously, great purse and yes, I paid a little bit more for the mauve as I was tired of black. I just love my purse!	This bag is lightweight yet very roomy. It has plenty of pockets for storage and organization. The safety feature makes it perfect for traveling although you need to keep the contents light to use as a cross bag. It comes in black, blue and mauve although the mauve looks like more of a purple.	This is a wonderful bag for traveling, especially if you are a heavy packer. The many pockets will help keep you organized. I would not purchase this bag if you don't have very many items to carry around, as it may be too large. Overall it is great if you need a large traveling bag.	I love this bag! It was exactly what I needed for my trip to Europe. It has all the pockets I could ever need, and I was able to fit my phone, camera, snacks, maps, a guidebook AND my Kindle, plus everything else I would normally carry while still being comfortable. The color seems a bit different than I remember, but overall it looks great.
cloth	B006UF64CW	I get constant compliments on these sandals. I order them every summer in a variety of colors. I had heel spurs and back problems so the cushy softness of these is the only thing I can wear comfortably and the small wedge heel is perfect for my back.	These thongs are fun, festive, flexible and surprisingly comfortable. I have very sensitive feet and I can wear these cuties all day. The arch support is great and there is a nice give in the sole. I love these so much I want to put a few pairs away in case they discontinue them. They go with everything.	I have been wearing White Mountain beaded sandals for a couple of years now and they are wonderful. They are lightweight and cushion the feet when worn for long hours. They are also beautiful and usually hold up for two or more seasons.	This was great price for this cute sandal. Unfortunately, the toe piece was very hard and they were a little narrow... unusual since I normally wear a B width. For the right person, they would probably be fine. They just didn't work for me.	I love White Mountain sandels. this is my 2nd pair of these shoes. I wore out the last pair after 2yrs. They are very very blingy and I like that. Would I order another pair? you bet I would / will.	Item was too small, purchased for a friend their size 9 is smaller than the size 8 in the store. Sent it to the wrong address, and I can not seem to find anyone that will tell me where my bill is. I will never buy from white mountain again.	I lived in sandals that looked exactly like this but I thought they were by Bjorn. I couldn't find them anywhere, but found these (go figure). While they aren't quite as comfy as my other ones, I think with a bit of breaking in they'll be just fine. Lots of compliments every time I wear them.	Not only are these SUPER comfortable (yes, even between your toes), they look great with just about anything I wear! I have been complimented on these daily!! I typically wear a 6 1 / 2, I ordered a 7 and they fit perfect!! I need more of these!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	These sandals are beautiful, fun, festive, and come in a variety of colors. They are light weight, comfortable sandals with great arch support, but run a little small, so buy the next size larger for a good fit.	These White Mountain sandals look very nice, people will take notice of them. They are comfortable but it may take some time for your foot to adjust to them. The softness can help with your back and arch support. They also hold up to extend use fairly well. Recommended for the right person.	These sandals are both very comfortable AND very stylish! They do run a bit small, so you may want to order 1 size up. Overall, a great shoe that you'll enjoy, even after a couple years of consistent use! HIGHLY recommend White Mountain sandals.
cloth	B00AZ6WVQU	The description say it long... NOT so it is average. That's why I purchased it because it said it was long. This is a basic tank.I washed it and it didn't warp but did shrink a little. Nothing to brag about.	I'm 5 '4 'and this tank fits like a normal tank top, not any longer. I was trying to find a tank that would cover past my hips, so I could wear it with leggings. Don't order if you're expecting tunic length.	This shirt is OK if you are layering for sure. It is THIN and runs SMALL. I usually wear a small and read the reviews and ordered a Medium. It fits tight and is NOT long like in the picture. Glad I only purchased one.	The tank fit very well and was comfortbale to wear. The material was thinner than I expected, and I felt it was probably a little over priced. I've bought much higher quality tanks for $5 at a local store.	The only reason I'm rating this at two stars is because it is listed as a 'long' tank top and the photo even shows it going well past the models hips, however I'm short and the tank top is just a normal length.	I usually get them someplace out but they no longer carry them. I thought I would give these a try. I received them fast, although I did order a brown and got a black (which I also needed a black anyway). They were a lot thinner than I like but they are okay.	Every women should own one in every color. They wash well perfect under everything. Perfect alone. As I write I'm waiting on another of the same style to arrive. Just feels quality I don't know how else to explain it, but I'm sure you get it ladies!	I bought this tank to wear under shirts when it is colder out. I bought one in white and one in an aqua blue color. They are long enough that the color peeks out from under my tops. Looks cute. I do wish that the neck line was a bit higher cut to provide more modest coverage of my chest.	Women's tank top fits well, runs a little small, but of good quality. It's a thin weight tank, great for layering. It comes in many colors. The only negative is that it's listed as long, but is actually a very standard length. If you want a regular, basic tank top, this is it.	overall not recommended product. the tank top is smaller and shorter than expected, so keep that in mind and order a bigger size. the cut on the chest is too big as well. but the product is good if you are going to use it for layering.	Great tank top to wear under my other shirts as I liking layering and the material has a good feel. There was a good choice of colors to pick from. Although, the top is a thin material I don't mind since I wear it under something else.
electronics	B000EB7OTU	Since I purchased this backpack a month ago, I have used it several times. It protects my new SLR camera and I can still put water bottles on the side, food and a jacket inside. Additionally, it is very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it.	I have this same model purchased from B & H. This one through Amazon is missing any sort of padding at the bottom of the bag. Basically your camera is sitting right on the ground with a thin layer in between it and any surface. Ridiculous and disappointing.	The main clasp for the bottom part isn't perfect... it's slightly bent and requires some manipulation to 'click.' The tripod's great, the cleaning kit's great. Be careful about that front clasp. It was shipped quickly though.	I like this bag very much, it can hold my SLR body along with 2 lens, even with one 70-300mm, although bit hard to fit in well. I would expect it little bit bigger, however current size looks perfect if carry out for causal travel. And the bag is good quality and solid. Nice backpack.	I found that this was too small for my D90, 70-300mm and 18-105mm. While it all fit in the bottom of the backpack, there was really no room to spare for future equipment. I wanted to use the top for personal stuff, so that I did not want to put camera equipment up there.	I recently bought Tamrac Adventure 7 backpack for my Nikon D80, and I used it during my vacation trip. I like it very much. It is well designed, the material made is durable, and practical pockets to put your camera accessories. I recommend this backpack. You'll get your money's worth.	I had at least two camera bags before this one, and never found the perfect fit.What can I say... I just LOVE this backpack, is comfortable, excellent size and does not look as if you were bringing a super camera.I would buy it again and strongly recommend this model	Great Backpack! It is well made, padded straps and back. I have a Canon 20D with grip and about four smaller lenses in the bottom. I do have to keep my Canon 70-200 2.8L in the top section with a lens wrap around it.	This is a sturdy, durable backpack that's functional and comfortable. There's room for an SLR- sized camera, and also room for a few personal effects, although it does lack much room for extra equipment. Will work perfectly for a casual day trip.	I love this bag,  purchase it a month ago, it was shipped quickly. It is well designed, comfortable to wear with a durable material. The tripod and the cleaning kits are great. I recommend this model and would buy it again. It's worth the money.	This camera bag, constructed as a backpack with padded straps and back is functional and comfortable to wear as well. It is roomy enough for the camera plus several accessories, and also has enough space for extras. It is well designed and made of durable materials. I would recommend this camera bag to most people, although some users with a lot of accessories may need more space.
electronics	B001H9O71Q	Basic GPS unit for those of an older age who do not use smart phones. The screen is small but for the price, a very nice unit. Touch screen and color graphics are a nice touch. If you are looking for the no frills, basic navigation system, save $50 + and buy the 'One'.	I'm a novice at electronics, and there are too many processes to go thru to get to what you want (to get to your destination) - once you figure out all of the buttons to push - it's a beautiful thing...	I got this because it was a deal. I should've known TomTom has a funny way of making you forced to update maps, and in LA a lot of stuff changes so you may as well not even bother with this thing. I use this now as a back-up gps. I just hope this thing does find if and when my phone dies.	Works great. Easy to use. Sometimes may try to take you on a weird route. Still have to have an idea of how you want to get somewhere so that doesnt happen. But, it will always get you to where you want to go.	I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it. She has her own business and must do a lot of traveling, this has been a great help to her in her travels. She is very pleased with it and I am so glad I got this for her gift.	I got a great deal on this TomTom. Not the latest technology (screen size, touch screen / talk options) but had all the features I needed (full street names big visuals). It hasn't dissappointed yet! I would recommended this to anyone.	very easy to set up and use! arrived about 2 days sooner than expected. i didn't even have to read the manual to figure out how to use it. i also like the speedometer on it (my car's speedometer isn't working).	I have purchased this nit back in 2011 and after couple month the battery kept dying.After researching this problem, it appears there is a known bug that the gps wakes up by itself and drains all battery.No firmware update ever resolved it.Avoid, not recommending, seems like a widely known issue.	It's a great deal, also easy to use and to set up. It has a known GPS bug and may sometimes try to take you on a weird route. Not the latest technology, but have all the features I need. I would recommend this to anyone.	Overall a great gps for the price, simple and easy to use. Makes a great gift for those not comfortable using a smartphone. May not keep up with the latest map updates, especially in a big city, so keep that in mind when using.	This GPS is easy to use and fairly inexpensive. As a backup unit it is nice to have but sometimes the map is not up to date and you will end up on a different route than intended. There is also a bug where the battery drains due to the GPS unit waking itself up and is an unresolved issue. This of course does not mean every unit is affected by this. It is easy to use and works great when there are no issues. For the price and accessibility it is recommended but with caution.
electronics	B001TKE25E	Good quality, everything that you need is included (except for the gang box of course). I'm using it with 16 AWG wires (they say they are 14 but I know better than that). It should fit 14 and maybe even 12 AWG. I'm not using banana jacks.	Cant give it 5 stars because the mounting screws that come with it are poor quality and will strip easily. Do yourself a favor, head to the hardware store and get the # 6 - 32 1 'combination machine screws and throw out the ones that come with this product. The white trim screws are OK, but not great.	cost much more from local retailers plus is a better product. some of the newer designs suck. plastic inserts don't try it if it says easier dont't buy it. this product works on old school. some times that's the best way. take a little longer to instal but no going back for loss wires	This is OK product. looks good and easy to install.Cons: Cover is not a standard size and you probably wont be able to replace it. In addition it does not flush everything completely (not deep enough) and there is a small gap left between the wall and the plate.	All the screw heads were painted shut. I had to dig them all out before I could screw them in. The rest of the plate is ok but I didn't enjoy spending a bunch of time digging the slots out of the screws. I'd recommend going with something else.	Bought five for my 5.1. Installed into the boxes in the wall well. 4 stars for having a slight gap between the wall and the plate after install. I only notice it at slight angels. Jacks are made well wires attached well.	Easy installation and looking nice. Much cheaper than brand product at local store. However, it doesn't look as nice as the brand ones either. I suspect the connectors are made of poorly gold-plated bruss or even other metal. But for my purpose and for the price, it is OK.	Came individually packaged, with mounting screws. The backing plate is plastic, but sturdy enough. Plastic is great for me as I live near the ocean and corrosion can happen. Great quality. Great price. Much cheaper than local home improvement stores.	This plate is plastic and comes with mounting screws. The screws are a bit stripped and difficult to work with but this product is a good deal cheaper than those at local stores. It leaves a gap between the plate and the wall but overall it looks good. You could use different screws other than what comes with this plate.	This mount is cheap, installs easily, and works well for most applications. It looks good, and the plastic is sturdy. However, the included screws are of suspect quality and may need to be replaced, and the back plate doesn't fit snugly against the wall. Overall, good for the price.	This is easy to install, and comes with everything you need. However, the mounting screws aren't great quality and it might be best to replace with something else.  It's much cheaper than branded products, but as it isn't a standard size, the fit might not be good on some walls.
electronics	B003YJ5LLM	Love the design of this sleeve. When I don't have a table I use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. Wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve.	This was bought for our teen daughter for Christmas, the only negative things about it are 1.no strap 2.no pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price.	This case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. I disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. The smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. I love the design and it was a fair price. Shipping was a little expensive though. It arrived quickly and I would buy from this seller again.	I really enjoy the design of this case but I thought it would be lighter. When it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. But the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop.	I like this case very much! It fits my Acer Aspire 14 'as a glove!!! Yes, it smells a little bit but I wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. And it's very cute too. I recommend this product to anyone.	I BOUGHT IT FOR MY ACER 14 ', IT IS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT, BUT THE WORST WAS IT HAS HEAVY RUBBER SMELL, WHEN I LEAVE THE CASE IN MY ROOM, THE RUBBER SMELL WAS FILLED WITH THE AIR EVERYWHERE OF MY ROOM, MADE ME SICK. DON'T BUY IT.	I have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. It's working well though and now I can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. I'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit.	I really love it! It doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well defined.I bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so I don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch,	This 14' laptop sleeve has an attractive design and is made of quality materials. It has a very snug fit, so be cautious of buying it if your laptop is even slightly over 14'. The only real issue is the rubbery smell that comes with it. Overall, I would recommend this, unless you have a sensitive nose.	This case fits so snug around my 14 inch laptop. The quality if very good with draw being well defined. There is a hint of a rubber odor that may be a turn off for some, but the smell goes away rather quickly. A great buy for the price.	This case is a very dark color. It has a good amount of padding. The fit is good on my 14 inch laptop. It has a smell that slowly goes away. Shipping was quick but a little expensive. I would recommend this to others, this product is just as described.
electronics	B004IV8Y50	I love this item. Im happy that it came with a color keyboard protector. It was super easy to put on and the color is great. I love that you can see the apple logo through it. Overall its a great product I totally recommend it.	The cover is very nice, just it does not fit snugly. There is extra room and unless I am very carefully about inserting the Macbook Air into the cover, the cover shifts around.If iPearl provided a better fit, I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars.	My case arrived before the estimated delivery date and I love it so far. It was VERY easy to put on my MacBook Air. I love the retractable feet; and the color purple that came matches the picture perfectly. Would definitely repurchase something else from this brand.	I ordered two of these covers after careful research and visiting retail stores. These covers were free shipping and were a snap to install. There are no issues whatsoever with them, so order them with confidence. Ignore the extra picky shoppers' reviews on here. Hope this helps.	I do not recommend this item. It's a pretty color, and it stayed on for a while. But the cover pops off the top of the clamshell too easily, and now it is more off than on. I am now shopping for a case from another maker.	I absolutely love the case! It fits my laptop perfectly! I received many compliments on this case with the keyboard cover that came with it! I love the keyboard cover as well. The cover is nice and thick. I love it! I would recommend these products to anyone that wants to protect their macbook in style. Nice sturdy case.	Love the the clip cover. I was pleased with the tilts stands in back. Places computer in perfect angle to protect my wrists. the keyboard cover is nice but taking a little used to the buttons having a different feel. over all very pleased with products. And products arriving in a very timely fashion as stated.	The iPearl cover fits like a glove and gives me just the amount of protection I'm looking for without bulk. It's priced well and showed up on time, as promised. Great product and customer service! What more could I ask?	The covers are exactly what I have been looking for and they are not hard to install.The price that I paid for them was a steal, and the time frame for me receiving it was faster than I expected.  I would give it 5 stars but  it takes a bit of effort to keep it on without slipping.	This case was easy to attach. The retractable feet that makes this a stand are really cool. The color is nice and you can see the apple logo through the case. The keyboard cover is very handy and this product feels sturdy. My case arrived very quickly. Good customer service!	This laptop cover slips on easily, but the loose fit can occasionally cause it to slip off as well. It comes with ergonomic tilt stands on the bottom, making long typing sessions more comfortable. It looks nice and has a good feel to it. Overall, I would recommend it.
electronics	B0051PJHDK	Very disappointing product...... bought it as a present and was not working.We returned it 3 times and they don't want to give you a refund. They only try you to upgrade to their newer version. Customer service is a joke. Pay $50 more for a better tablet it will save you a lot of headache.	I purchased one of these units 2 weeks ago, alas it has to be returned as the battery is defective. I purchased from Abe, s Of Maine thru Amazon and the customer service was top notch except i have to pay shipping to return it but that, s better than a $154 paperweight.	I got this tablet as a free gift, but didn't think it was this cheap! I got the tablet and had it for about 1 month. My kids used it to play games which seemed to work fine until one day about a month after having it would no longer power up. What do I do? It seems like such a waste.	Received tablet 6 days after order was made and worked fine till Tuesday Nov.15th at which time it stopped holding a charge. Worked fine when connected to power but shutdown when power was disconnected. Come on, it should last longer than 30 days. Paid $150 + for a product only lasting alittle more than 30 days.	7 'Skytex Skypad Alpha. Charging is hit or miss but mostly miss. It would have been OK if not for the charging issue. I e-mailed tech support for a charger replacement but no response from them. Hacked Netflix was working but not anymore after Netflix upgraded their system. Netflix issue is notSkytex 'fault.	This product is not worth buying. I bought 2 as Christmas gifts directly from the company. 1 doesn't work properly and the other is just junky. I tried to return the product but they are unwilling to take it back. Waste of your money!	Bought this one for my dad as a gift. Thought he would like it being that it was a tablet... just avoid the discount models, go with one you know they will like. Maybe a good fit for someone who doesn't know much about electronics.	The tablet is not the best in the world but for $150 its a good deal. I do feel bad for anyone that paid $400 + for it because its not worth anywhere near that. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap tab	This tablet has numerous reliability issues. The likelihood of it malfunctioning after a month or less of normal usage is high, assuming it's not dead on arrival. Even considering the cheap price, it's still not worth the money.	This tablet is not worth the money, no matter what they are charging for it. It is of very poor quality and stops working after a very short time. It is especially prone to battery malfunction. Worse, the customer service from the manufacturer is almost nonexistent and it is difficult to return. Don't waste your money.	Buying it at MSRP is ridiculous and in fairness, buying it at a discount presents a huge risk as well. The charging is spotty at best and the battery itself presents a lot of risks. Avoid it until they start caring about the quality.
electronics	B005ZA2W42	This product recharges my wife's iPhone 4 with no problem. One downside - it does not have enough juice to charge an iPad. It would benefit from some indication of the percentage charge of the battery. Also, the LED light is VERY bright.	The product is great .The issue is that it came broken and I only found out after I had it for a month. There is no was to call there support. Very very bad idea. Will do more research next time .I don't think I would buy it again!!!!	I bought this to test it out for charging my phone on AT section hikes. For the added weight, it was a nice-to-have item. I probably wouldn't have it on a through-hike, but it worked well and if you aren't going to have access to a power source for recharging your phone while you're out, it does the job pretty well.	This solar charger works perfectly. It can be charged with electricity or solar power making it a great backup for charging devices. For its size I would recommend getting one and putting it in your but out bag for use with e-devices.	I ordered this charger to take on safari to South Africa. It is suppose to charge an iPhone and Kindles. It doesn't work with either of mine. It was a waste of money for me. I'm very disappointed.	Charges up, charges your devices. The flashlight is really bright. I had to take a star off because the charge battery doesn't hold a charge over a period of time. However don't go cheap, this product is worth the money.	This is my first solar charger, so I can't compare it to any others. I will say that the flashlight is extremely bright as noted by others. It seems to do a nice job charging my Droid Bionic but it didn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire.	I left it out for 24 hours in direct sun, the lights on the side showing the progress of charging blindly blinked, but the charge gave my iPod only 1 / 10 of full battery. I tried again and placed it in the sun for 2 sunny days straight, again, after multiple annoying blinking signals, it did not charge anything. Returned.	This solar charger works well at first and charges phones well but does not adequately charge iPads or Kindles. The LED flashlight is quite bright. Performance over time is not reliable as the charge battery begins to not hold charge. A battery charge level indicator would be helpful. Overall, a decent purchase for a backup or travel.	The solar charger is good fit for travel bag. The LED light is one of the best function of this charger as its very bright. Though will recommend this charger to charge the cell phones only as it does not have capacity to charge other devices such as Tablets.	This charges our phones with no problem, but we haven't been able to get a full charge on a tablet out of it so far. It's great for hiking and camping since there is a nice bright flashlight incorporated into it. I wouldn't trust it as your only charging source during a power outage if there is no sun. If the sun is shining, you'll be fine since it can use solar energy to charge. You can also charge it quickly with electricity, if you prefer.
health_personal_care	B000EXUB3E	I love these protein bars in the vanilla flavor. They taste like Rice Krispies treats with vanilla frosting. I can't believe they are actually 'good' for you. I usually try to stay away from processed foods, but these are my guilty pleasure -- I eat them for dessert all the time. I like them MUCH better than the chocolate NuGo bars.	Nugo bars are great for breakfast, lunch or a snack. I keep them in my desk at work and my husband keeps them in his car. Eat them with a tall glass of water and they will keep you satisfied for hours. They are low-glycemic and taste great. I'm so glad I can order these from Amazon!	Apart from the obvious nutritional value, the taste was surprisingly better than I anticipated. Normally, if I find soy-based nutritional bars tend to have a chalky or tree-bark-like texture and taste. I dare say, the texture reminds me of a healthy-not-too-sweet 'Rice Krispy Treat'.	I tried these for the first time at work, and loved them. BUT they sell them for $3.80 a bar! And even though they are totally worth it, I wanted to purchase my own box. My kids even got to try them and they really like them too! I will be ordering two boxes next time around!	Love the bar, love the taste, love the 170 calories... LOVE it, my husband and son love it too---we eat way too many of them but I dont feel guilty as it is a great and healthy snack on the go!! This one is my favorite of all!	I find these a little chewy (my jaw gets tired towards the very end), but that could just be me. I love these. I think the flavor is good. They keep me feeling fuller longer than other brands that I've had. My work has them and I loved them so much I ended up coming here to get a whole box.	Very Good! We all eat these and other bars in our house for meal replacements. These are one of their favorites but they are very sweet! In comparison, there are bars that have better ingredients but this one is good! They remind me of rice krispy treats!	I love this flavor of NuGo bars. Not many grocery stores carry it, so when they do I buy all they have on the shelves. When I am out of them I have to order them online. I always keep one or two in my purse for when I am out and hungry and don't care to buy junk food.	These NuGo bars are fantastic and taste great like a Rice Krispy treat. Good for morning, lunch or afternoon snack and a good way to get your protein in-take. They keep you full for a long time especially if you are out and about. I keep one in my purse to eat on the go.	Can be a little pricey at $3.80 per bar, but these NuGo bars offer a low calorie, low glycemic index snack that is healthy and still taste great. Taste is reminiscent of Rice Krispie treats, especially the variety with vanilla frosting. Some stores don't carry these bars, but they are available easily online.	The NuGo bar is very good and tastes better than you would expect and nutrition bar to taste.They have a texture similar to rice krispy treats. There's a good chance your family members will love them too. At only 170 calories you get a delicious snack and something with good nutritional value. They may be a little hard to find if looking in stores but can be ordered form Amazon. Overall, the NuGo bar is a great recommendation.
health_personal_care	B000EZUQK0	The capsules MUST be kept in the original container with the drying agent.If you place them in your own container for later use - you will find a pile of powder and a paper shell. I wouldn't want to guess their shelf-life.And don't expect a notice on the label!	I have only used this for 2 weeks and I have noticed a huge difference in my workouts. Also my veins are popping out!!! I highly recommend this product! Works way better than every other high priced NO product.	Unlike the other user. I think these pills are of good quality. I often take a couple out of the container and pack them with my lunch or for work and have not had a problem with them turning into powder.Great price and good quality.	Some of these tablets blow up for me as well. When i tried to use the the blown up loose tablets... severely burned my tongue... like battery acid! http: / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / B0013OVX3U / ref = cm _ cr _ rev _ prod _ img	Well I cant really say how they work since I got the 500Mg but order the 1000Mg so im taking 2 500 not really filling a diffrents yet I know this take time right about the end of the botle I will see a diffrents	I saw one reviewer post the tablets bust and that is true. The bottle comes with 120 Tablets and I got to use about half of them normally the rest i had to strip the tablet layer and dump into my pre workout. I really like now products but this one was a bust literally. Go with the cheaper Walgreens brand those do not break open.	I bought this for my sister who was having... ummm... shall we say desire problems. Apparently your libido pretty much disappears on some antidepressants. This, according to her, worked like a charm and brought hers back. I would consider buying it for that purpose.	I could deal with the large size of the pill, but when I put them in my weekly pill case, the pills expanded and disintegrated into a powdery heap! I read the label and it didn't say anything about storing in original container. Very upset with this product. Not sure if this supplement even helps.	These pills will do the job, that's if you get to use them long enough to notice they are working. The label on the bottle doesn't state this, however, if you do not keep these pills in the original bottle with the drying agent, they will bust and turn into powder making them unusable.	I think this supplement is great. It is a very good value for the price. I do highly recommend that you store them in the original container, because humidity it definitely not it's friend. I have followed the instructions exactly, and it has done wonders for me. There are many brands that are more expensive, but this brand is just as good, if not better.	The tablets provide a good pump when they actually decide to stay tablets. They tend to seemingly break apart in the container, just leaving powder behind. It is at a great price, at least.
health_personal_care	B000YA8NYQ	This is rated the best pill for motion sickness. dramamine pills are really strong and can make you sleepy. you will also hear about ginger. the bad thing about ginger is if you really throw up its no going to be good, i mean tasting the ginger. hope this help everyone.	I have such severe motion sickness, that I can't even SLEEP on a ship! But I was able to enjoy my 5 day / 4 night cruise, as long as I left one of these in my mouth to dissolve. I even slept with one! I highly recommend this product.	I brought this along my 7 night cruise trip - works great even though I tend to forget taking it until I already feel the motion sickness. My cruise happened to meet some heavy showers and I felt no dizziness or sickness except the constant waving feeling:) Definitely will bring it along next time I go to cruise again or plan to ride roller coasters.	This is my favorite type of motion sick medicine. It doesn't make me drowsy and it works well. The chewable tablets don't taste too bad and I'd rather chew a tablet than swallow one whole anyway. Great product!	I've been taking this medicine since I was a little one and it works great! I get motion sickness so easily, but if I take one Bonine, I don't get sick! I can travel for hours in the car, ride all the looping, twisting, crazy rides at the amusement parks and not get sick! It's wonderful.	I stopped riding on roller coasters and other rides at most amusement parks until I started taking the BONINE tablets. Works well for me and I take it in the morning about an hour before going on any ride and I have been able to enjoy the rides with my kids!! No more nausea and headache!!!	Product worked the very way it was intended. We were on a cruise that had high seas and because we were unable to use the patches that go behind the ear, we used this as an alternative. It worked great, no problems.	Husband and I went on week long live-aboard scuba trip. I could not have had a good time without these. THANK GOD.. it was a wonderful trip, and I did not get sea-sick at all, in a full week never leaving the small yacht we dove from. Recommend!	Bonine tablets are an excellent choice for preventing motion sickness. They effectively prevent motion sickness from cars, boats, and amusement park rides. A bonus: the chewable tablets do not cause drowsiness.	This medicine works really well on cruises and for roller-coaster rides. You could take a week long trip on a boat and still not get sick. The tablets are chewable or can dissolve in the mouth,  and unlike Dramamine they don't cause drowsiness.	Bonine helps with motion sickness from roller coasters, water, and car travel. They do not make me sleepy. The chewable tablet is easy to take and it does not taste bad. I was able to enjoy a cruise recently because I had these tablets. They worked as advertised and helped me a lot with my motion sickness.
health_personal_care	B002BJU8YQ	I was unsure of replacing this battery from a backup power supply from Goodwill. But the price was right, the battery can in good condition, and worked as advertised. I'd say I'm totally happy with this item and will recommend it to anyone else looking for this type.	Was not the brand as advertised. Was Genesis and not Yuasa (perhaps the same manufacturer). Lasted for 2 years in my APC UPS. The plastic case is now bulging. I just ordered another Yuasa from a different company. Let's see what arrives.	We ordered this battery to replace the one that went bad in our home alarm system. It was a perfect match, works well, and arrived BEFORE the expected delivery date. The price was also a great deal! I would definitely buy from this seller again.	It seems that many of the buyers out there reports defective Dead On Arrival battery from various replacement purchases. This is the case with mine, as it does not hold a charge.Its going to cost me about the same just to return it to the seller.Wish there was better quality control	Simple to install as a direct drop-in replacement for the existing / failing battery. Wish there was a return for the dead cell to allow for proper recycling, but I found a local store that would take the dead one and do the right thing with it...	This battery is of good quality and holds a charge quite well. Alarm companies charge an arm and a leg for a battery that costs them only this much and are of similar specs. Save yourself a bunch of money and do this replacement yourself.This name brand is a name that we are all familiar with and can trust	Great value for a quality battery. Fast shipper and superb customer service. Purchased for a gate opener. Have had for only 3 weeks but so far, have met my needs and expectations. Would definitely recommend and purchase from this vendor again.	Works great. Great price. Bought it to replace the dead battery on my ups for my computer. The size appears to be a common size because it fit perfectly. Now I wish I swapped batteries on my old ups instead of filling up the land fill.Good product. Go for it.	This battery is a good replacement for old or failing batteries in a home alarm system or computer. The battery works well and is a really good value for the money, compared with other brands with similar specs. I was especially pleased with the fast shipping from the seller.	Save yourself the money and use this battery to replace your alarm system battery yourself. Calling the home alarm system company to replace the battery costs way mire than just doing this yourself. This battery holds a fantastic charge and replacement is not difficult at all.	This is a good battery that is easy to install and works as a replacement for failed batteries. The price is good and a much cheaper alternative to use as a replacement. While there are instances of DOA batteries, most experiences are positive. With a good price and easy installation this battery is recommended.
health_personal_care	B0039PH51K	Always consult with your doctor before purchasing any circulation product after surgery. I had ankle surgery and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot. This increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot (only after doc said wait bearing was okay). I use it sitting down barefoot.	I really like the Acupressure Mat. I usually toss and turn a lot when I sleep, now I use this before I go to bed and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.	I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since. After 2 ten minute sessions, I am sold. I have slept much better at night - I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep. A rather inexpensive option to relieving tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders.	This is the best thing! you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it. I use it every morning to walk across to jump start my body. when I think about it I will lay on it, it feels wonderful.	I love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache. its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work. Helps with pain in my back and pain in my legs. Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.	I wish I hadn't purchased this item. I just can't get use to it, it's not comfortable. I have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because I don't relax or use it for long enough.	I run an alternative health center and use Acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S & H was outstanding and really fast.	I ordered this acupressure mat to see if it would help relieve my back pain and at first it seemed like it wasn't doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief and it also helps you relax. I use it almost everyday now and it really helps. I recommed this product and this seller.	The Acupressure mat is great for helping to relax. It takes a little bit of time to try it but once it works it works well. The mat helps with pain and pressure and is great to lay on, it is great for falling asleep on. Also it is great for blood circulation and for walking on bare feet.	These acupressure mats are used to increase circulation and reduce body aches and pains and are most effective when you can fully relax. Consistence is key to receive the full, relaxing benefits of the product.  However, if you are using this product after surgery it is responsible to always consult with your physician to ensure it is right for your situation.	This acupressure mat can help ease aches and tension, increase blood circulation to extremities, and aid in general relaxation and restfulness. It can also assist in healing, as it reduces movement while sleeping. However, it takes some getting used to, and being unable to relax while using it will make it ineffective.
health_personal_care	B004U3Y9FU	These are a good value, but they're NOT burp-less. They tend to make me burp for up to an hour or two after taking them. I don't like fish, so I was terrified of fish burps, but they're actually not terrible and don't taste very 'fishy.'	Well, I've taken the first softgel capsule and given it enough time now and I can say it is, indeed, truly burp-less, unlike certain other fish oil products I've tried that shall remain nameless. If I pass away due to coronary disease, I'll consider lowering my rating of it but I'll still have appreciated its burp-lessness.	i've tried the nature made original Fish Oil before and i didn't like the fishy smell and sometimes bad burp after taste... But this Burp-less version is really better as i haven't burped and it has no fishy smell... I'm switching to this one permanently..	My husband takes 4 per day - I take 2. The price on Subcribe & Save is good. The product is consistant high quality, delivered same time each month and I don't have to go to the store to find the shelf empty. Product is worth the purchase. I know I will get the same product every month and its a good product	I couldn't handle the burping up of fish smell that other fish oil gels came with. And preferred not to use the liquid version. This gel is great. I been using it for months now--and not one burp!:)	If you are like me I like sushi but I couldnt stand the constant taste of it when I was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why I stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and I did but it didnt matter. I love this fish oil it does what it says..	I have been using Nature Made products for years. I feel Amazon offers them at a great price. These Fish Oil caps are the burp less variety which I would recommend to others if you take Fish Oil daily as I do. I would order them again. Also received them within a few days.	For anyone like myself who uses Omega 3 Fish oil on a regular basis, I recommend this product. This is the burp-less version which leaves no after taste in your mouth and is easily swallowed with a small amount of liquid. Stay heart healthy and take Omega 3 daily.	These soft gel capsule are not like ordinary Fish Oil capsules. If you do not like the fish oil smell in your burps these soft gels are perfect fit. This is burp-less version and will not bother your breathing with any smell or any burps. The price is definitely worth the quality of the product.	Using the Omega 3 Fish oil tablets will  give you a great blueprint for better health. Imagine not having to take the medicine and then burping afterwards, this burp- less version does this.   I have it on auto ship and love not ever missing a dose or having to look for it in the stores.	I found this fish oil very good, and i don't like fish. the burps are present but less than other fish oil products. soft gel structure doesn't leave fishy aftertaste. I am pleased with the product.
health_personal_care	B006ZO110I	I've been using this for about two years and refilled twice. The only thing is I didn't pay attention that this one has a wand which I don't need since I have one and it is still in very good shape. I was looking for just refills. But in any way it's easy to use and works well for us.	I love these cleaners. They are easy to use and do a great job. Some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but I think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets.	I love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? Chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! What a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	These are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). I use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) Good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean.	These are great buys. They are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, I always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money.	I have been using these for a long time, what I like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. Clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job.	i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable.	Who wants to stick their hand in a toilet? Not I! I love the wand and the refills are wonderful. NO touching required, and they scrub very well! My toilet bowl is gleaming after using these!! I'll never use anything else.	I love these cleaners, it does a great job and it's easy to use. I like that they are disposable. They scrub very well, no touching required and the refills are wonderful. It is well worth the money.	I love using these for cleaning my toilet they are easy to use, work really well and very good for scrubbing. Once used up you can dispose off it easily, does the job very well, good buy.	amazing product, single use toilet cleaners do a great job. they keep toilet sanitary and cleaning process is mess free. a lot better than reusable brushes. But the might be discontinued, so stock up while you still can. would not want to use anything else after i tried this product.
home_kitchen	B0000CCY1S	I bought the Kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the OXO brand. Would not buy this brand again. When slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't contentiously keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing.	I am not excited about this peeler and wish I had found an easier tool. I have julienned my fingers using it - very sharp just like their other peelers which I have and love. It is difficult to use on carrots without injuring my fingers, maybe I just can't get the hang of it!	This is my 3rd purchase of julienne peelers the 1st 2 didn't work \u2026 waste of money. This one is the best ever! I have been making zucchini noodles and so many other things! Try this recipe I made! [...]	This julienne peeler works fantastic! I like the shield, I had to be very careful with my other on in the drawer to not get cut reaching for something. It is so much easier to handle with this grip and the blade stays in place. I would buy this product again.	This little guy performs really well and is comfortable to handle for long periods. The blade guard is a little weird in how it pivots, so it's kind of difficult to clean. My guard actually broke off, so I just left it off. The blades on this thing are quite sharp! So be careful if the same happens to you.	The Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great gadget. I use it to Julienne zucchini and eggplant. Zucchini Julienned and sauteed quickly with EVOO, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper is a terrific side dish. Even people who do not like zucchini will eat this.	It's easy to use and clean. It's a good price and does exactly what I wanted. I bought it to make julienne veggies carrots, zucchini noodles. It makes shorter pieces than a big fancy spiralizer, but that's good for me.	Strong and it works. I made zucchini noodles with this handy little device and now it looks like I'll be making this more often.Julienne the noodles and lightly salt them while the noodles are drying, make whatever sauce you are going to pour over them. The heat from the sauce should cook the noodles to a perfect al dente.	This is a nice little julienne peeler, it does a fantastic job when making zucchini noodles or slicing carrots. It is not as effective for fruit, which gets stuck and makes it hard to keep slicing. It's VERY sharp, watch your fingers! Overall, this Oxo has a comfortable grip and is a great deal.	The Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is very handy, comfortable, and works great. It's a fair price and cuts well. But it's very sharp, so be careful when handling it. You may have to stop slicing occasionally to clear out the blade if the veggies get stuck, but overall, it's very easy to use and to clean.	while there are some products that may be cheaper and seem like they might work better short term, but the Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great tool in the kitchen as is durable for the long haul.. while it is extremely sharp, the shield provide excellent safety and support for your hand. All in all this is an excellent assistance to using a knife. Buy this soon
home_kitchen	B000N6MI7E	These magnets are definitely not strong enough to be worthwhile, even for light objects. Try the ones rated for 25 lbs... even though that's probably overkill for your needs, at least you'll KNOW that they're adequate for any task.	These compact magnets sound too good to be true and do actually look nice in-person, but they don't hold the weight. I wanted to hang hot mits on my fridge, but it took some finagling to get it to stay and I could only put one mit per hook.	I purchased these hooks specifically for the purpose of hanging potholders on the magnetic fridge. They work but you have to gently hang them to prevent the hooks from sliding down. They may, however, work better on other magnetized surfaces. They are tiny and cute but I would not recommend using them as refrigerator magnets.	I purchased the set some years ago and loved how strong the magnets used on the hooks were. I ordered more last week and discovered that the magnets are now 1 / 4 the size on the previous version. The magnets are not at all as strong, and I am very disappointed.	The actual magnets are + / - 1 / 4 'in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things. Did not work for my 6 keys plus a car fob.The hooks look good though. That said, I am sending them back.	for the size of the hanger, it has a very low magnet.doesn't hold too much - not even a small kithen towel. might hold a small keychain... had to cannibalize 3 out of the 5 to make 2 hold some weight.	The magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal surface.Unfortunately, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame. My frame is an 8x11 docuement with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards.	These are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys. They have a diameter of about 3 / 4 of an inch. I wanted to put aprons on them, but they are not big enough, nor strong enough. They have a micro sized magnet on the back that is strong for its tiny appearance.	These hooks look good but looking good is about all they are good for. The magnets on these are tiny (about 1/4 of an inch) and they do not hold much of anything. If you are lucky they might hold a key chain but only if it has one or two keys on it and you have to hang it on the hook gently. These hooks can hardly even hold a pot holder. Definitely would not recommend this product if you are actually trying to hang something on them.	These hooks are decent for hanging up very small things. Common household essentials such as oven mittens or kitchen towels are possible to hang up, but give a hassle with the hook sliding down. The magnets attach to the hooks are too small to handle many things, but are pretty strong for it's size.	These magnets are not strong enough to hold the kids of things I might use a magnetic hook to hold, such as keys, oven mitts, or picture frames. I had to use several at a time to hold up even light objects. Otherwise, the objects tend to slide down the fridge.

Case looks durable.I use these for protecting very expensive microphones I keep in sealed Tupperware style cases.	I put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'Soggy. I had to recharge it by baking it. The only this I would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water.	I'm really not sure how good this is going to work. According to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. When I got mine the indicator was already mostly green.	Even though the humidity in the areas I used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. I bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. Way too much energy. I'll probably need a stationary dehumidier.	Love this little unit. Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry.	This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack.	My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. He likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it.	Our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.	It did not work properly, the photocopy machine jams often. But the case looks durable and the unit is quite small to fit in any container of my choosing. It is also rechargeable by using an oven to dry it out.	Easy, convenient way to prevent humidity and moisture in small areas and containers such as safes, cabinets, jewelry boxes, and more. Features a color indicator to notify you when the pack has reached capacity. Easy to recharge by placing inside of an oven to dry the crystals out again. Doesn't work well in large areas, even with multiple packages.	This little unit is efficient for smaller environments that aren't overly  humid. If you have a large safe or super damp space, this might not be the most practical option. The case is durable, and I like that there's a green indicator light that tells you when you need to dry it in the oven. I'd recommend it for a jewelry box, smaller weapons safe, or a cabinet with documents.
home_kitchen	B0036SGFXO	I had in the past bought and a chicken roaster in South Africa but I now cannot find anyone who sells them. I went on to Amazon and found this product and I have received them and am very happy with my purchase.	My husband and I use this all the time to cook whole chickens now. We don't bother putting a beer can in it. I've used it several times on the grill as well as in the oven. The chicken comes out perfectly cooked and the skin nice and crispy every time!	I like the pan under the chicken to catch the drippings, but it is awful tall. even using the bottom rack of my oven the chicken almost touches the broiler. no way it would fit in our bbq. it really makes great tasting chicken!!	VERY EASY TO USE AND LOVED THE WAY THE CHICKEN COOKED. JUST ANOTHER GREAT WAY OF COOKING ON YOUR GRILL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO TURN IT AROUND. YOU PUT IT ON YOUR GRILL AND GO DO YOUR SIDE DISHES WHILE YOUR CHICKEN IS DONE.	Works well, a little small thou. I usually get the biggest roaster chicken I can find (usually 6-7lbs) but this seems a little small for that size chicken (5 - 6lbs would fit better). However, love the drip pan feature, it collects all the juices so you can baste! For the price, I would Definately recomend it!	Five stars for the collapsible design. It holds a normal size beer can but not a bottle. I only use it as a stand (humidity is irrelevant for a Char-broil infrared cooker), and it is very solid. Goes right on the rack or grill without any fear of tipping, and holds a large chicken.	This worked okay, but it didn't make much change for our grilling. I thought my husband would love it, but he was pretty apathetic... and we've only used it once - as it's a bit cumbersome. So, I guess it's okay but not 'necessary.'	This is a perfect substitute for doing rotisserie chicken in the winter when the Barbie won't heat up to temp. I use two of them at the same time to put two chickens in the oven at 475 degrees coated with Sams Rotisserie Rub and it turns out perfect every time... no beer can needed- the chickens stay moist on there own.	This chicken roaster works both in the oven and on the grill. It's a great way to cook a whole chicken and has a pan underneath to catch all the drippings. It can be used with a beer can or without, and holds a large chicken. It's a little tall, so it may not work in all ovens and barbecue grills.	Excellent for cooking whole chickens perfectly when traditional grilling is not possible or inconvenient. Features a collapsible design and the drip pan underneath catches any drippings making for an easy clean up, or to use for basting. Best for medium sized chickens so it properly fits inside the oven or grill.	the chicken roaster is a good product. makes delicious chicken, has a way to put a beer can in to produce a good crunchy crust. is a little small if you are used making a big chicken, also need to keep in mind that roaster adds to the size, so it might be too big for the over or the grill.
home_kitchen	B00442C8RS	Very different from what I'm used to which is a regular freezer ice maker. It's kind of a process if you use all the time, which I do, you develop a system. Makes ice fast. Simple to operate.	Gave this as a gift to my daughter and son-in-law for their deck. The have numerous pool parties and according to my daughter, this works great. It prevents wet feet from going in the house to get ice. It fits nicely on their deck and they seem to be enjoying it.	I thought this was exactly like my current ice maker but when it got here it wasn't. Once seeing it I wondered what size it was going to make but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the large cubes. It ended up being all it was advertised to be and I love it. I would recommend it to all.	This thing works like a charm. We use it in our bar at home and in our RV when traveling. You just have to remember to empty it when not in use and keep it clean. It does the job for parties! Very fast and efficient.	absolutely love it!!! this is the 2nd one we have. The 1st one lasted 8 years!!! I love having ice made all the time. I have it made by the refrigerator also but I love this machine better.	It worked as advertised although I didn't check to see if it make the actual 27 pounds per day. I bought it for the camper and seemed to satisfy the demand for ice. It sure beats paying $3 / bag at the camp store. It won't take long to pay for it.	So far I love this device. It cranks out ice in minutes. Perfect to have for entertaining, We actually bought this as a back up for our unreliable built in ice maker in our fridge. This has saved the day.	We have had this machine for 2 years. It sits outside on our patio in Arizona. It hits 115 degrees in the summer. It has been cleaned one a month and has NEVER stopped or had any kind of problems. We just keep filling it with water and it keeps making ice 24 / 7 / 365.	Perfect ice maker for camping or any large gathering. It makes large ice cubes quickly and is easy to use. It works as advertised and saves you from spending money on pre-made ice at the store. It's also well made and if well maintained, it will last for years. I highly recommend it.	Awesome ice maker that is easy to use, makes ice quickly, and is much more reliable than most ice makers built into refrigerators. Works well for parties and entertaining, RV traveling, as well as to save money not needing to buy ice from the store. It will eventually pay for itself!	This ice machine is pretty much perfect for any environment. We've had it sitting outside all day in the heat during parties and we've taken it along in our RV for ice at the campsite. It makes nice large ice cubes 24/7. It's so simple to use that my young kids usually take care of it, and it's easy to clean, too. If you do a lot of entertaining or camping, you can't go wrong with this ice machine.
home_kitchen	B006CO18RM	It is a great vacuum, it work very nicely but... The electric hose is heavier than he non electric one and significantly heavier. My arm gets tired more quickly. I got a canister to avoid having a heavy weight on my arm, but his one is heavier than expected.	My first Miele vacuum... great to use on hardwood floors, tile and area rugs. Could be better for wall to wall carpeting but there are more expensive Miele vacuums for that purpose. Like that it has special filters to remove allergens from air and love that it is so lightweight.	Too bad there isn't a way to rate this higher 'cause I would. Very quite. A little pricey, but you get a quality product for your money. Wife likes it, and has vacuumed more than she used to with the old vacuum it's so much easier to use. And did I mention quiet?	I moved from a house that had a cental vacuum system. I was concerned about how happy I would be with a separate vacuum cleaner (not central system). I love my new Miele vacuum cleaner! It is stronger than my central vacuum for me! Pathetic canister moves with ease and the retractable ford is great. Love this system!!!!	From the get go, this vacuum is a keeper. It is super quiet yet has the suction power of a shop-vac. The vacuum is simple to use and lightweight. Our only issue was that the box was very damaged upon receipt, but there is no apparent damage to the machine. Concerning that it would even be shipped due to the box damage.	It really sucks. What do I mean. Well, first, it really does a great job of sucking up dirt, always a good ability for a vacuum cleaner. It also sucks because the replacement bags are pricey and need to be changed out every other month in our cat and child-filled household.	Very high quality vacuum. Read the reviews before you buy. The old reliable names are no longer the same quality. Miele is one of the best. You get what you pay for. Thanks Amazon for making my choices easier to research and purchase.	I can't believe we went so long without the Miele! For years we fell for the Dyson gimmicks and I honestly feel stupid about the amount of money we have thrown at them after a few months with the Miele. It is so quiet and super light and unlike the Dyson it will actually do carpets!	The lightweight, quiet and easy to use Miele vacuum is a great and favorable against other competitors Vacuum's such as Dyson. The Miele has filters that help with eliminating allergens from the air. One thing regarding the bag replacements is that they can be a little pricey. Overall the Miele vacuum is recommended.	A really great quality vacuum from Miele such a good product. Really handy to use around the house on rugs, carpet or hardwood floors and its lightweight. It was a little pricey but what is price when it does a good job. Also its really quiet as well. I give it a thumbs up.	This Miele vacuum is wonderful at sucking up dirt.  It is quiet, and easy to use.  The price is a bit higher than other vacuums on the market but the quality of the product is reflected in its price.  This is a bagged vacuum, so there is an added expense of the bags to be factored in.
home_kitchen	B006Y401K0	I just redid my kitchen all in purple. This is a great color and it is really big. I bought two of them and I am so happy, it holds a lot of utensils. And very pretty too. It is sturdy, not cheap junk.	I was having such a hard time finding a large enough utensil crock, that of course also matched my d\u00e9cor. I have the chunky orange utensil set from Rachael Ray & definitely needed something this size. It's perfect & beautiful. Love it!	This utensil crock met all my expectations! I love the color and it holds quite a few kitchen tools! I'm glad I DIDN 'T go with the 1qt. size! Great size, fits easily in a corner on my countertop! If you need a handy storage containter and want it to look great on your counter top this is what you want!	For some reason the crock shows to be taller and slimmer in THIS COLOR, but it's not. It's the wider and slightly shorter one I wanted. It's very pretty. Plenty room for everything, including the utinsils with the larger rubber handles.	This crock is very large and gives you plenty of room for utensils (especially now that many utensils have the thick rubber handles). I was able to condense from 2 drawers to 1 now that I have this crock on the counter. Seems very high quality and looks beautiful.	Tired of fighting to get my cooking utensils out of another type of vessel Le Creuset proves once again to be my top choice in the kitchen. This crock gives plenty of space for over a dozen everyday utensils, looks perfect on the counter and is not too large getting in the way of work space. The white color is classic for any decor.	I LOVE this utensil crock! Le Creuset has never let me down and the color is just fabulous. By being larger than expected, I was delighted to find that ALL my cooking tools fit, with room to spare. Its a perfect addition to my kitchen, and its a magnificent color.	I love the color and it fits in with other pieces that I have. It is a good size for holding items. It is a slightly different shape than the one I already had so it makes a nice contrast sitting on the counter top.	This product is a great addition to any kitchen! The color is fantastic and it's sturdy build is perfect for holding as many kitchen utensils as it does! It holds a lot of utensils without being too big and bulky so it fits nicely on the kitchen cabinet. Definitely would recommend for any kitchen!	This Le Creuset crock is sizable, able to hold over a dozen utensils, including ones with thick rubber handles. It will save drawer space, and be an attractive addition to any kitchen.	The utensil crock Le Creuset is a perfect fit for any kitchen. You will love the color and the space to hold many kitchen tools. It takes smaller space but give you bigger space to store key utensils at one spot. Definitely recommend this Simply beautiful and reliable product.
